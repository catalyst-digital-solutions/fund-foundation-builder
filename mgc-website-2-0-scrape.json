The shame of pulling out your debit card while everyone else swipes credit. The weight of knowing your financial past is stealing your financial future.\n\nThis isn't about a number on a report. This is about your dignity. Your opportunities. Your family's future.\n\nAnd it ends here.\n\nFeatured in local and national media for our proven financial solutions\n\nWe Did the Heavy Lifting. You Get the Results.\n\nYou've spent enough time feeling stuck. Enough nights lying awake wondering how you'll ever get ahead. Enough years watching everyone else build wealth while you're just trying to survive.\n\nThat cycle breaks today.\n\nMost people navigate their financial lives across dozens of disconnected platforms—one for credit monitoring, another for loans, a third for estate planning. It's inefficient, confusing, and leaves critical gaps in your strategy.\n\nBut here's what really costs you:\n\nThe hours wasted researching which companies are legitimate. The money lost on trial-and-error with the wrong services. The opportunities missed because you didn't know where to start.\n\nMesa Group eliminates all of that.\n\nWe've spent years building relationships with the nation's premier financial service providers—from credit restoration platforms to business funding networks to estate planning technologies.

With confidence.\n\n6.9%\nnot\n18%\n\nThe finance manager is smiling.\n\n\"We're buying a house.\"\n\nThey don't have to move again.\n\nYou're building something\nthey can inherit.\n\nThis isn't a fantasy. This is what happens when you have the right partner.\n\nYou stop living paycheck to paycheck because you consolidated that debt at a fraction of the interest.\n\nThis is the freedom good credit creates.\n\nYou stop losing sleep because you have estate planning in place—your family is protected.\n\nThis is the opportunity smart money decisions unlock.\n\nYou stop wondering \"what if\" because you secured that business funding and finally launched.\n\nThis is the legacy Mesa Group helps you build.\n\nYour financial past doesn't have to define your financial future.\nNot anymore.\n\nWhy Families Choose Mesa Group When Everything Else Has Failed\n\nYou've tried fixing it yourself. You've looked at other companies. You've spent money on services that promised results and delivered excuses.\n\nWe get it. Trust is earned, not given.\n\nHere's why 2,500+ families decided Mesa Group was different—and why they were right.\n\nWe've Actually Been There\n\nMost financial companies are run by people who've never struggled with bad credit. Never been denied. Never felt the shame of financial rejection.\n\nNot us.\n\nOur founder had a 490 credit score. Failed business. Nearly empty bank account. He watched his immigrant parents almost lose their home and everything they built when they risked coming to this country. He knows what it feels like to be stuck.\n\nThat's why Mesa Group operates different. We're not here to judge you. We're here to guide you—because we've walked the exact path you're on right now.\n\nYou're not talking to salespeople. You're talking to people who understand.\n\nWe Built the Shortcuts You Need\n\nYou know what separates people who succeed from people who stay stuck? Information.\n\nThe wealthy have financial advisors, estate planners, CPAs, credit specialists, funding networks. They have access.\n\nMesa Group gives you that same access.\n\nWe spent years building relationships with SmartCredit, SuperMoney, Novae, and more. We negotiated partnerships so you get enterprise-level tools without enterprise-level prices.\n\nThe shortcuts the wealthy use? Now they're yours too.\n\nYour Success is Our Success\n\nHere's the difference between Mesa Group and everyone else:\n\nOther companies: Get paid whether you succeed or not. They take your money upfront, deliver mediocre results, and move on.\n\nMesa Group: We only win when you win. Our reputation is built on your transformation. Your referrals. Your success stories.\n\nThat's why we work harder. That's why we care more. That's why we've maintained a perfect 5-star rating across 150+ Google reviews.\n\nWhen you succeed, you tell people. And that's how we grow.\n\nWe're not here to make a quick buck. We're here to build generational relationships with families who trust us with their financial futures.\n\nThat trust? We protect it with everything we have.\n\nGetting Started is Straightforward\n\nWe've designed our process to be transparent, efficient, and friction-free—so you know exactly what to expect at every step.\n\n1\nFree Consultation\n\nSchedule a conversation with our team to discuss your current situation, goals, and challenges.

Testimonials reflect individual client experiences and are not a guarantee of similar outcomes. All testimonials are from actual clients.\n\nWhy I Built Mesa Group—And Why It Had to Exist\n\nAt 25, I had bad credit, a failed business, and nearly nothing in the bank.\n\nBut that's not even the painful part.\n\nThe painful part was watching my immigrant parents almost lose their home in 2008—not because they were lazy or irresponsible, but because no one ever explained how the financial system worked. They worked two jobs. They paid their bills. They did everything they were supposed to do.\n\nAnd the system still almost crushed them.\n\nI watched my family file bankruptcy in the early 2000s. I saw what it did to them—the stress, the shame, the feeling of failure even though they worked harder than anyone I knew.\n\nWhen I tried to start my own life, I repeated the same mistakes. Credit cards I didn't understand. Loans I couldn't afford. A business that collapsed under debt I didn't know how to manage.\n\nI'll never forget the feeling of checking my credit score for the first time: 490.\n\nI felt like a failure. Like I'd let my family down. Like I was destined to repeat their struggle.\n\nBut then I realized something that changed everything:\n\nBad credit doesn't mean you're irresponsible. It means no one taught you.\n\nAnd if no one taught my parents—hardworking immigrants who risked everything to come to this country and build a life—then how many other families were out there navigating this system blind?\n\nThat's why I built Mesa Group.\n\nSo it could be the strategic financial partner my family never had when we needed it most.\n\nToday, we've helped over 2,500 families and businesses. We've facilitated over $100M in funding through our partner networks. We've turned 490 credit scores into mortgage approvals. We've turned denied loan applications into funded businesses.\n\nBut here's what I'm most proud of:\n\nEvery single client we've helped is now equipped to teach the next generation. They understand how credit works. They know how to access capital. They can build wealth that lasts.\n\nThat's the real legacy. Not fixing credit—breaking generational curses.\n\n— Evert Jafet Calderon, Founder & CEO\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nGet answers to the most common questions about Mesa Group's services.\n\nIs Mesa Group a credit repair company?\nHow is Mesa Group different from other financial services companies?\nWhat services does Mesa Group offer?\nHow long does it take to see results?\nDoes Mesa Group guarantee specific results?\nIs there a free consultation?\nWhat areas do you serve?\nHow do I get started?\nServing since 2023\n2500+ Clients Served\n150+ 5-Star Reviews\nTrilingual Support\nHelping Clients Nationwide\n100% Customized Solutions\nEN/ES/Punjabi Support\nReal Office You Can Visit\nReady to Transform Your Financial Future?\nSchedule My Free Consultation →\n\nOr call us: (661) 310-3040\n\nHablamos español | We speak Punjabi\n\nHave a question about credit, funding, or your next financial move?

We're Here to Rewrite Your Financial Story.\n\nMesa Group was built by someone who lived through bad credit, financial mistakes, and the shame of being turned down—so you'd never have to navigate it alone.\n\nSince 2023, we've helped 2,500+ families and businesses break free from financial limitations. Not because we had some magic formula—but because we've been exactly where you are.\n\nSchedule Your Free Consultation\n(661) 310-3040\n2,500+ Clients Served\n150+ Five-Star Reviews\n$100M+ in Funding Facilitated\nTrilingual Support\nWhy \"Mesa\"? Because Money Should Be Discussed at the Table—Not Hidden from It.\n\nIn most households, there's an unspoken rule: you don't talk about money at the dinner table. Finances are private. Struggles stay hidden. Pride keeps the conversation closed, and the cycle continues.\n\nMesa Group was founded to change that.\n\n\"Mesa\" means table. We named this company to challenge that silence.\n\nWhat if families actually sat down and talked about credit? About debt? About building something for the next generation? What if there was someone at that table who understood the struggle—and could show you the way forward without judgment?\n\nThat's what we built.\n\nMesa Group Consulting was founded by a first-generation American who watched his immigrant parents navigate a financial system no one explained to them. He saw the foreclosure notices. The bankruptcy filing. The sacrifices they made because they didn't know there was another way.\n\nAnd when he tried to start his own life, he made the same mistakes.\n\nCredit completely shot. Failed business. Nearly empty bank account. No guidance. No blueprint. Just the belief that there had to be a better way.\n\nThat journey—from financial rock bottom to building a company that has helped thousands of families take control of their future—is the foundation of everything we do.\n\nToday, Mesa Group serves clients from all backgrounds and walks of life. Because bad credit doesn't discriminate, and neither do we.\n\nWhether you're a young professional trying to build from scratch, a parent trying to buy your first home, or someone rebuilding after life knocked you down—you deserve guidance that meets you where you are.\n\nThat's why we exist.\n\nThe Man Behind Mesa: Why This Is Personal\n\nAt 25, Evert had bad credit, a failed business, and nearly nothing in the bank.\n\nBut that's not even the painful part.\n\nThe painful part was watching his immigrant parents almost lose their home—not because they were lazy or irresponsible, but because no one ever explained how the financial system worked. They worked two jobs. They paid their bills. They did everything they were supposed to do.\n\nAnd the system still almost crushed them.\n\nEvert watched his family file bankruptcy in the early 2000s. He saw what it did to them—the stress, the shame, the feeling of failure even though they worked harder than anyone he knew.\n\nWhen he tried to start his own life, he repeated the same mistakes. Credit cards he didn't understand. Loans he couldn't afford. A business that collapsed under debt he didn't know how to manage.\n\nThe day he checked his credit for the first time? It was rock bottom.\n\nHe felt like a failure. Like he'd let his family down. Like he was destined to repeat their struggle.\n\nBut then he realized something that changed everything:\n\nBad credit doesn't mean you're irresponsible. It means no one taught you.\n\nAnd if no one taught his parents—hardworking immigrants who risked everything to come to this country and build a life—then how many other families were out there navigating this system blind?\n\nThat's why he built Mesa Group.\n\nNot to build a business. To build a movement—one family at a time.\n\nHe built it to be the strategic financial partner his family never had when they needed it most.\n\nLet's Talk About Your Financial Goals\nThe Results\n\nToday, Mesa Group has:\n\nHelped 2,500+ families and businesses transform their finances\nFacilitated over $100M in funding through partner networks\nTurned denied applications into mortgage approvals\nTurned failed businesses into funded success stories\nBuilt a perfect 5-star rating across 150+ Google reviews\n\nBut here's what Evert is most proud of:\n\nEvery single client Mesa Group has helped is now equipped to teach the next generation. They understand how credit works. They know how to access capital. They can build wealth that lasts.\n\nThat's the real legacy. Not fixing credit—breaking generational curses.\n\nThis isn't just business for Evert. This is personal. This is his family's story.\n\nAnd it's probably yours too.\n\nGet Your Free Consultation\nOur Mission: Financial Freedom for Every Generation\n\nTo provide fast, ethical, and empowering financial solutions that help people across all generations and backgrounds take control of their credit, funding, and financial future.\n\nWe are deeply committed to serving first-generation families and communities that traditional financial services have historically overlooked.\n\nWe help the younger generation avoid the mistakes we made. We show the older generation that it's never too late to start. And we treat every client—whether they walk in with a 300 or an 800—with the same respect and dedication.\n\nThree Promises We Make\nTo the Young Professional Building from Scratch\n\nYou won't repeat the mistakes your parents made—not on our watch. We'll teach you how to build credit the right way from day one, so by the time you're ready to buy your first home or start your business, you're approved—not denied.\n\nTo the Parent Fighting for Your Family\n\nYou deserve that mortgage approval. You deserve to stop paying someone else's mortgage with your rent. You deserve to build something your kids can inherit. We'll show you the path from where you are to where you want to be.\n\nTo the Entrepreneur Rebuilding After Setbacks\n\nYour past failures don't define your future success. Bankruptcy, divorce, medical debt, business collapse—we've seen it all, and we've helped people come back stronger. Your comeback story starts here.\n\nReady to Start Your Journey?\nRooted in Faith, Family, and Financial Freedom\n\nThese aren't just words on a wall. They're the principles that guide every decision we make and every conversation we have.\n\nFamily First\n\nWe treat our clients like family because that's how we were raised.\n\nEvery conversation and strategy comes from a place of respect, loyalty, and commitment to lifting each other up. When you work with Mesa, you're not just a client. You're part of the family.\n\nWhat this means for you:\n\nNo judgment. Ever. We've been where you are.\nWe celebrate your wins like they're our own\nWe stay with you through the entire journey—not just the transaction\nFaith-Led Purpose\n\nEverything we do is rooted in service, compassion, and belief.\n\nBelief in God. Belief in community. Belief in the power of new beginnings. Faith guides our vision and reminds us that we're building something bigger than ourselves.\n\n\"Where God guides, He provides.\" — Isaiah 58:11\n\nWhat this means for you:\n\nWe operate with integrity because we answer to a higher standard\nWe believe your breakthrough is already written—we're just here to help you walk it out\nWe pray for our clients' success as much as we strategize for it\nIntegrity Always\n\nWe move with honesty and transparency, even when it's inconvenient.\n\nOur clients trust us with their future, and we never take that lightly. No shortcuts. No broken promises. No illegal tactics. Just real results built on real ethics.\n\nWhat this means for you:\n\nWe tell you what we CAN do and what we CAN'T do—upfront\nWe comply with every federal regulation (FCRA, CROA, TSR)\nIf we can't help you, we'll tell you that too—and point you in the right direction\nEducation Over Shortcuts\n\nAnyone can file a dispute. We teach you why it matters.\n\nReal transformation happens when you understand how credit actually works, not just how to fix it temporarily. Our goal isn't just to repair your credit. It's to make sure you never need us again.\n\nWhat this means for you:\n\nYou'll understand every step of the process\nYou'll learn how to maintain and protect your credit long after we're done\nYou'll be equipped to teach the next generation what no one taught you\nExperience the Mesa Difference\nWhere We're Going: Redefining Financial Success\n\nTo redefine what financial success looks like for first-generation families and underserved communities by making credit, ownership, and wealth-building tools accessible, practical, and empowering for everyone.\n\nWe envision a future where:\n\nYoung people have the knowledge to build early\nOlder generations are given the confidence to restart\nFamilies break financial cycles for good\n\nMesa Group exists to shift the mindset from survival to ownership, one legacy at a time.\n\nThe Impact We're Creating\n\nBy 2030, our vision is to have helped:\n\n10,000+ families achieve homeownership who thought it was impossible\n5,000+ businesses access the capital they need to scale\n50,000+ individuals understand credit well enough to never fall into the same traps again\n\nBut the real measure of our success?\n\nWhen your kids don't have to Google \"how to fix bad credit\" because you already taught them how to build it right.\n\nWhen your grandkids inherit wealth instead of debt.\n\nWhen \"financial literacy\" isn't some fancy term—it's just what your family does.\n\nThat's the Mesa legacy.\n\nBuild Your Legacy with Mesa\nWe Serve Real People with Real Financial Challenges\n\nMesa Group works with clients at every stage of their financial journey—from rock bottom to soaring high.\n\nYoung Professionals & Credit Builders\n\nStarting from scratch or recovering from early mistakes.

We negotiated partnerships so you get enterprise-level tools without enterprise-level prices.\n\nThe shortcuts the wealthy use? Now they're yours too.\n\nYour Success Is Our Success\n\nHere's the difference between Mesa Group and everyone else:\n\nOther companies: Get paid whether you succeed or not. They take your money upfront, deliver mediocre results, and move on.\n\nMesa Group: We only win when you win. Our reputation is built on your transformation. Your referrals. Your success stories.\n\nThat's why we work harder. That's why we care more. That's why we've maintained a perfect 5-star rating across 150+ reviews.\n\nWhen you succeed, you tell people. And that's how we grow.\n\nComprehensive Solutions for Every Financial Need\n\nFrom credit building to business funding, estate planning to debt relief—we've partnered with the nation's leading platforms to give you everything under one roof.\n\nCredit Cards\n\nCompare and choose offers from top providers to suit your needs.\n\nPersonal Loans\n\nReceive pre-qualified offers with loans up to $250,000 in less than 60 seconds.\n\nAuto Loan Refi\n\nOffers in less than 60 seconds with loans from $10,000 to $100,000.\n\nStudent Loan Refi\n\nUp to $500K, 20 yr term.

It's the difference between a 4% mortgage rate and an 8% rate—costing you $200,000+ over 30 years.\n\nIt's getting denied for that business loan. Paying $3,000 deposits on apartments. Being passed over for jobs (yes, employers check credit).\n\nHere's the truth: Most negative items on your credit report contain errors, outdated information, or unverifiable data. Under federal law (FCRA), you have the right to challenge these items.\n\nBut navigating disputes with Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion? Tracking responses? Negotiating with creditors? It's a full-time job.\n\nThat's where we come in.\n\n78% of credit reports contain errors or outdated information\n\n— Federal Trade Commission Study\n\nTired of Missing Opportunities Because of Credit Report Errors?\n\nEvery loan denial. Every \"sorry, you don't qualify.\" Every night worrying your past mistakes will follow you forever.

Start your free analysis and we'll recommend the best fit.\n\nGet Free Analysis\nCommon Questions About Credit Repair\n\nGet answers to common questions about our credit repair service.\n\nHow long does credit repair take?\n\nFirst results typically appear in 30-45 days after bureaus respond to initial disputes. Significant improvements (50-100 point increases) usually take 3-6 months. Complex cases with many negative items may require 6-12 months for maximum results. We provide realistic timelines during your free analysis.\n\nIs credit repair legal?\n\nYes. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) gives you the legal right to dispute inaccurate, unverifiable, or unfair information on your credit reports. Credit repair companies simply exercise these rights more effectively than most consumers can alone. We're fully compliant with CROA, TSR, and California CSO regulations.\n\nWhat negative items can you remove?\n\nWe can challenge any item that is inaccurate, unverifiable, or unfairly reported—including late payments, collections, charge-offs, repossessions, foreclosures, bankruptcies, judgments, tax liens, and unauthorized hard inquiries. However, we CANNOT remove accurate, verifiable negative items. Even 'accurate' items often contain errors (wrong dates, amounts, missing documentation) that make them removable.\n\nHow much will my score improve?\n\nAverage clients see 60-110 point increases over 6 months. Some with multiple removable items gain 150+ points. However, improvement depends on your starting score, credit history, and how many negative items are successfully removed. We provide realistic expectations during your consultation—no false promises.\n\nWhy can't I just dispute online with the bureaus myself?\n\nYou legally can—and some people succeed. But DIY has major drawbacks: (1) Takes 10-15 hours/month, (2) Generic disputes are easily rejected, (3) You need expertise in FCRA violations, Metro 2 compliance, debt validation, (4) No creditor relationships for negotiations, (5) One mistake can hurt your case. Professional service saves time and increases success rates significantly.\n\nWhy can't I talk to someone before signing up?\n\nDue to FTC Telemarketing Sales Rules (TSR) for credit repair, we legally cannot do phone consultations until you've signed an agreement and provided payment details. This protects consumers from high-pressure sales tactics. However, you CAN: (1) Use our live chat for questions, (2) Review our free credit analysis online, (3) Read all terms before committing. Once you're a client, phone support is available.\n\nWhat if the bureaus verify the account I'm disputing?\n\nIf a bureau verifies an item on the first attempt, we don't give up. We try alternative strategies: (1) Direct creditor negotiation, (2) Goodwill letters for accurate-but-old items, (3) Debt validation requests to collectors, (4) FCRA violation identification, (5) Re-dispute with additional documentation. Multiple dispute rounds often succeed even after initial verification.\n\nWhy We Can't Offer Phone Consultations (Yet)\n\nYou might notice we can't talk on the phone until you sign up. This isn't because we're hiding anything—it's federal law.\n\nThe FTC's Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) prohibits credit repair companies from doing phone or live consultations before a signed agreement. This rule exists to protect consumers from high-pressure sales tactics.\n\nHere's what this means for you:\n\nYou can ask questions via live chat anytime\nYou can review your free credit analysis online\nYou can see all pricing and terms upfront\nYou have a 3-day right to cancel after signing\nOnce you're a client, phone support is available\n\nIf another credit company offers phone consultations BEFORE you sign up, that's a major red flag—they're breaking federal law.\n\nReady to Fix Your Credit the Right Way?\n\nJoin hundreds of Bakersfield residents who've improved their scores and unlocked better financial opportunities.\n\nProfessional Credit Repair\n91%\nSuccess Rate\n60-110\nAvg.

This isn't just credit restoration—it's a complete financial transformation program powered by our proven Mesa360 Credit System™.\n\n2,500+ Clients\n150+ 5-Star Reviews\nBakersfield HQ\n🇺🇸 English | 🇪🇸 Español | 🇮🇳 Punjabi\nStart Your Credit Transformation →\n\nPowered by Mesa Group\n\nGet Free Credit Analysis\n\nFeatured in local and national media for our proven Mesa360 Credit System™\n\nWe Know You've Been Promised Quick Fixes Before.\n\nYou've probably seen ads promising to \"erase bad credit in 30 days\" or \"guaranteed 100-point increases.\" Here's the truth: those promises are not only unrealistic—they may violate federal law.\n\nBad credit doesn't define you.\n\nIt's just a chapter in your financial story. And with the right strategy, it's a chapter you can rewrite.\n\nMaybe you're stuck in the cycle:\n\nDenied for mortgages, car loans, or credit cards because of your score\nStuck paying sky-high interest rates that cost you thousands extra\nCollections calls and letters that won't stop\nFeeling overwhelmed by the dispute process\nTried DIY dispute letters with no results\nBurned by \"credit restoration\" companies that disappeared with your money\n\nSound familiar? You're not alone—and there's a proven path forward.\n\nThat's where Mesa Group's Mesa360 Credit System™ comes in.\n\nThe Mesa360 Credit System™: Your Complete Financial Transformation Blueprint\n\nHere's what makes us different: We don't just erase bad marks and disappear. We walk beside you through the entire journey—from breaking free of the mistakes holding you back, to building the financial foundation that changes everything, to positioning you for opportunities you thought were out of reach.\n\nThis isn't a service. It's a partnership. It's a transformation. It's your second chance, done right.\n\nPHASE 1\nBREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS\n\nWhat's Really Holding You Back\n\nBefore we can move forward, we need to understand what's anchoring you to the past. Not just the obvious stuff—but the hidden damage, the errors, the items that shouldn't even be there.\n\nDeep Credit Forensics\n\nWe pull your credit from all three bureaus—Experian, Equifax, TransUnion—and perform a forensic analysis. Not a 5-minute glance. A real investigation.\n\nWhat We're Looking For:\n\n• Collections that aren't yours or can't be verified\n• Late payments reported incorrectly (wrong dates, wrong amounts)\n• Charge-offs missing required documentation\n• Bankruptcies that should have aged off years ago\n• Inquiries you never authorized\n• Accounts reporting wrong balances or fabricated payment history\n• Identity theft red flags hiding in plain sight\n\nThe Truth Moment:\n\nMost people discover 3-7 items on their report that are either completely inaccurate or can't be legally verified. You're not asking for favors. You're demanding accuracy. That's your right under federal law.\n\nWhat You Get:\n\n• Free 3-Bureau Credit Analysis (normally $50+ value)\n• Written breakdown of every negative item—and whether it's disputable\n• Honest assessment of your timeline and what's realistic\n• Custom dispute strategy built for YOUR situation, not a template\nPHASE 2\nREPAIR WHAT'S BROKEN\n\nRemoving the Weight You've Been Carrying\n\nNow the real work begins. We don't send generic letters. We don't use offshore call centers. We don't \"set it and forget it.\"\n\nYour dedicated account manager—a real person who knows your name, your story, your goals—builds a custom dispute strategy based on FCRA/FDCPA law, your unique credit profile, and the specific violations we found.\n\nOur Arsenal of Advanced Methods:\n\nDirect Digital Uploads to all 3 bureaus (faster than mail, harder to ignore)\nExperian Rapid Inquiry Removal (proprietary access most companies don't have)\nDirect Creditor & Collector Disputes (going straight to the source)\nCFPB Complaints (when bureaus stonewall you, we escalate to federal oversight)\nMetro 2 Challenges (advanced formatting disputes for complex items)\nLegal Team Escalation (when they violate FCRA, we bring in the attorneys)\n\nWe Handle Everything:\n\n• All communication with bureaus and creditors\n• All follow-ups, re-disputes, escalations\n• All documentation, tracking, and compliance\n• Every 35 days, you get a detailed progress update in your client portal\n\nYou don't lift a finger. You just watch the progress.\n\nPHASE 3\nBUILD YOUR NEW FOUNDATION\n\nLearning to Win Long-Term\n\nHere's where most credit repair companies fail you: they remove the bad stuff, take your money, and ghost you. Then 6 months later, you're back where you started because nobody taught you how to actually BUILD credit.\n\nNot here. Not with Mesa360.\n\n1-on-1 Financial Coaching (Included in Every Plan)\n\nYour account manager doesn't just file disputes. They teach you the game.\n\nYou'll Master:\n\n• Credit Utilization Mastery – How to use cards without hurting your score (it's not just \"keep it under 30%\")\n• Strategic Application Timing – When to apply for new credit and when to WAIT\n• Positive Payment History Building – Building good credit while we remove the bad\n• Credit Mix Strategy – Understanding why account diversity matters (and how to build it safely)\n• Long-Term Protection – Avoiding the traps that got you here in the first place\n\nMonthly Strategy Calls:\n\nEvery 35 days, you're not just getting a \"here's what got deleted\" email. You're getting on the phone with your account manager to:\n\n• Review what changed (and why)\n• Adjust strategy based on results\n• Answer questions about next steps\n• Plan for major financial moves (buying a car, applying for a mortgage, etc.)\n\nCustomized Action Plan:\n\nNo cookie-cutter templates. No \"here's what we tell everyone.\" Your roadmap is built for YOUR goals:\n\n• Trying to buy a house in 6 months? We structure around that.\n• Need business funding? We position you for that.\n• Just want financial peace? We focus on stability.\nPHASE 4\nOPTIMIZE FOR MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY\n\nPositioning You to Win\n\nWe don't just repair your credit. We optimize your entire financial profile so when opportunity knocks, you're ready to answer.\n\nFunding Profile Optimization\n\nWe help you understand:\n\n• How lenders actually evaluate your profile (it's more than just your score)\n• Which accounts to open (and which to avoid)\n• How to position yourself for maximum approval odds\n• When to apply for mortgages, business funding, loans\n• How to leverage good credit for wealth building\n\nStrategic Credit Building\n\nLearn which tradelines add value, which hurt you, and how to build strategically—not randomly.\n\nExit Strategy & Life After Restoration\n\nWhen you graduate from our program, you don't just leave with a better score. You leave with:\n\n• Complete understanding of how to maintain it\n• Knowledge of when to refinance high-interest debt\n• A plan to leverage your improved credit for financial growth\n• Confidence that you'll never need credit repair again\nWHY THE MESA360 CREDIT SYSTEM™ ACTUALLY WORKS\n\nIt's Comprehensive\n\nWe don't just dispute items. We educate you, support you, and coach you through total financial transformation.\n\nIt's Personalized\n\nYour credit situation is unique. Your strategy should be too. No generic templates. No one-size-fits-all.\n\nIt's Proven\n\n• 2,500+ clients nationwide\n• 150+ five-star reviews\n• 83-point average score increase\n• Real results you can verify\n\nIt's Legal\n\nWe follow FCRA/FDCPA regulations to the letter. No shady tactics. No gray areas. No putting you at risk.\n\nIt's Backed by Real Legal Power\n\nWhen creditors or bureaus violate your rights, we don't back down. We escalate to our legal team—real attorneys who've recovered thousands in settlements for clients whose rights were violated.\n\nImportant: Legitimate credit restoration takes time. While we cannot guarantee specific results, most clients see measurable improvements within 45-90 days. Individual timelines vary based on the complexity of your credit situation and credit bureau responsiveness. The bureaus have 30 days to investigate each dispute, and most items require 1-2 dispute cycles to resolve.\n\nREALISTIC TIMELINE & EXPECTATIONS\nThe Truth About Credit Restoration:\n\nAnyone promising \"30-day miracles\" or \"guaranteed 100-point increases\" is lying to you—and possibly breaking federal law.\n\nHere's What's Real:\nDAY 1\n\nAnalysis\n\nDeep credit forensics & strategy planning\n\n30 DAYS\n\nFirst Results\n\nBureau investigations complete (by law)\n\n45-60\n\nMomentum\n\nSecond dispute cycle for complex items\n\n90 DAYS\n\nTransformation\n\nMost clients see measurable improvements\n\nMost clients see measurable improvements in 45-90 days\n\nCredit bureaus have 30 days by law to investigate disputes\n\nComplex items often require 1-2 dispute cycles to resolve\n\nYour individual timeline depends on the complexity of your situation\n\nWhat We CAN Promise:\n\nWe'll work your file aggressively within legal boundaries\n\nWe'll communicate transparently every step\n\nWe'll adjust strategy based on results\n\nIf new items appear during the process, we work on them at no additional charge (monthly plans)\n\nIf we don't deliver results in 90 days, you get 100% of your money back\n\nNo false promises. Just real work. And real results.\n\nWHY MESA GROUP ISN'T LIKE OTHER CREDIT COMPANIES\nWhat Actually Matters\tMesa Group Financial Enhancement\tTypical Credit Repair Companies\tDIY Dispute Letters\nThe System\tMesa360 Credit System™ – Repair, Rebuild, Optimize.

You're gaining a partner, a coach, a dedicated team that succeeds when YOU succeed.\n\n🏢\nTypical Companies = Transaction\n\nThey want your money. They don't care about your transformation. Send letters, collect fees, move on to the next customer.\n\n📄\nDIY = Isolation\n\nYou're alone, confused, and likely making mistakes that could make things worse.\n\nWHEN LEGAL ESCALATION HAPPENS\n\nYour Rights Are Protected By Federal Law—And We Make Sure They're Enforced\n\nWhile Mesa Group Consulting is not a law firm, we work with licensed attorneys who specialize in consumer protection and FCRA violations.\n\nWhen We Bring in the Legal Team:\n🚨\nBureau Fails to Investigate Within 30 Days\n\nFederal law requires a response within 30 days. If they ignore you, we escalate to legal.\n\n🚨\nCreditor Re-Reports Deleted Information Without Verification\n\nOnce an item is removed, they can't just put it back without proper proof. If they do, that's a violation.\n\n🚨\nCollector Contacts You After Cease & Desist\n\nUnder FDCPA, once you tell them to stop, they must stop. Violations = potential damages.\n\n🚨\nBureau Reports Inaccurate Info After You've Provided Proof of Error\n\nIgnoring documented proof of inaccuracy is a violation of your FCRA rights.\n\n🚨\nAny Other Violation of Federal Consumer Protection Laws\n\nWe don't tolerate violations. Period.\n\nWhat Legal Escalation Looks Like:\n\nParalegal FCRA/FDCPA Audits of your entire case\n\nAttorney Review of violations and potential claims\n\nLegal Demand Letters sent to creditors and bureaus\n\nSettlement Negotiation Support when violations are clear\n\nDocumentation for Potential Litigation if needed\n\nReal Financial Impact:\n\nMany qualified clients have received cash settlements ranging from $1,000 to $2,500+ when creditors or bureaus violated their rights—in addition to removal of inaccurate items.\n\nThe Bottom Line:\n\nWe don't make promises we can't keep. We make progress you can measure. And when your rights are violated, we fight back with real legal power.\n\nThis Isn't Just Credit Restoration. It's a Complete Financial Transformation.\n\nMost credit recovery companies send generic dispute letters and disappear. At Mesa Group, every client gets a dedicated account manager, customized action plan, monthly reviews, and 1-on-1 financial coaching.\n\nCustomized Action Plan\n\nYour account manager creates a personalized roadmap based on YOUR unique credit situation—not a one-size-fits-all template.\n\nDedicated Account Manager\n\nA real person assigned to your case who knows your name, your story, and your goals. No random reps each time.\n\nMonthly Progress Reviews\n\nEvery 35 days: what was disputed, what was removed, what's in progress, and your next steps. We walk you through everything.\n\nCredit Building Education\n\nLearn how utilization works, when to apply for credit, building payment history, and protecting your credit long-term.\n\nOngoing Support\n\nQuestions answered throughout the process. Guidance on major decisions like buying a car or applying for a mortgage.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nRemoving items is half the battle. Without learning to build good credit, you'll end up back where you started.\n\n\"I came to Mesa Group with a 540 score and collections I didn't understand. My account manager, Maria, didn't just file disputes—she explained every step, taught me how credit utilization works, and helped me build a plan to keep my score high after the program.

I'd tried DIY dispute letters with no results. Within 75 days of working with Mesa Group, they removed 6 inaccurate collections and my score increased from 540 to 695. Last month, I closed on my dream home in Bakersfield.\"\n\n— Sarah M., Bakersfield, CA\n\n\"100+ Point Increase in Under 4 Months\"\n\n\"I came to Mesa Group in the low 500s. Great experience, great communication. Across all three bureaus, we're up over 100 points. I was able to get approved for a business loan I'd been denied for twice before. Believe in the process.\"\n\n— Carlos R., Kern County, CA\n\n\"Tried DIY for 6 Months—Got Nowhere\"\n\n\"I wasted 6 months trying to do it myself with templates from the internet. The bureaus ignored me. Mesa Group removed 3 items in the first 60 days—items I'd been fighting on my own for half a year. Wish I'd hired them sooner.\"\n\n— David R., Bakersfield, CA\n\n\"Transparent Pricing, No Hidden Fees\"\n\n\"I signed up for the monthly plan. Transparent pricing, no hidden fees.

We need this to:\n\nSee your actual credit reports to file accurate disputes\nTrack your progress in real-time (you see what we see)\nEnsure both you and your account manager have the same information\nCatch new items immediately\n\nCost: $1 for 7-day trial, then $27.99/month\n\nImportant: SmartCredit is a third-party service not owned by Mesa Group. You maintain direct control over your account.\n\nWhy This Matters:\n\nWithout real-time monitoring, we're flying blind. Disputes could be resolved and we wouldn't know. New items could appear and we'd miss them. SmartCredit keeps everyone aligned—and keeps you in control.\n\n90 Days. Real Results. Or Every Dollar Back.\n\nWe don't just talk about results. We put it in writing with our legally backed 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee.\n\nHow It Works\nYou Hold Up Your End:\n✓ Keep SmartCredit 3-Bureau monitoring active\n✓ Stay responsive to your account manager\n✓ Keep your account current\n✓ Avoid adding new late payments during the 90 days\n✓ Follow your account manager's guidance\nWe Deliver Results:\n✓ Remove at least 1 verifiable negative item within 90 days\n✓ Provide monthly progress reports and portal access\n✓ Work your file with advanced dispute methods\n✓ Escalate violations to our legal team when needed\n\nIf We Don't Deliver:\n\nYou get 100% of your money back. Every dollar you paid to Mesa Group.\n\nWhy We Can Offer This\n\nBecause we're that confident in the Mesa360 Credit System™.\n\nMost clients see results in the first 30-45 days. We use advanced dispute methods, not cookie-cutter templates. Your dedicated account manager works your file personally. Our reputation depends on your success.\n\n✨ This is The Mesa360 Guarantee.\nReal Results in 90 Days — or Your Money Back.\n\nWhat's Not Covered by the Mesa 360 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee\n\nTransparency is important to us. Here's what the Mesa 360 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee does NOT cover:\n\nSmartCredit Monitoring Fees\n\nThe $27.99/month SmartCredit subscription is a separate third-party service and is not refundable through Mesa Group. SmartCredit has its own cancellation policy.\n\nCases Where Client Responsibilities Aren't Met\n\nTo qualify for the guarantee, you must:\n\n•\nKeep your SmartCredit monitoring active for the full 90 days (no 30+ day gaps)\n•\nRespond to your account manager's communications (no 30+ days of silence)\n•\nKeep your Mesa account current (no invoices 30+ days past due)\n•\nAvoid adding new negative items during the first 90 days (new late payments, collections, charge-offs)\n•\nAvoid multiple new hard inquiries during the initial dispute period\n•\nFollow guidance provided by your account manager\nNew Negatives Added During Service\n\nIf you add new late payments, new collections, or other new negative items after enrollment, those items are not covered by the removal guarantee. The guarantee applies to items on your report at the time of enrollment.\n\nAccurate, Timely, and Verifiable Information\n\nFederal law (CROA) prohibits us from guaranteeing the removal of accurate information. If bureaus and creditors properly verify that negative items are accurate, complete, and timely, those items may remain on your report despite our best efforts. We can only legally dispute items that are inaccurate, incomplete, unverifiable, or outdated.\n\nRuby & Emerald (Prepaid Annual Plans) After 90 Days\n\nThe 90-day money-back guarantee is your primary protection for annual plans. After 90 days, refunds are evaluated case-by-case based on work completed, as these are prepaid programs.\n\nRisk-Free Credit Restoration: You've Got Nothing to Lose\n3-Day Cancellation Right (All Plans)\n\nFederal law (CROA) requires that we honor a 3-day cancellation period. If you enroll in Mesa 360 and change your mind for ANY reason within the first 3 days, you can cancel and receive a 100% refund of all Mesa fees paid. No questions asked.\n\n90-Day Money-Back Guarantee (When You Meet Your Part)\n\nIf you follow all client responsibilities for the first 90 days and we don't remove at least one negative item from your credit report, you get 100% of your money back. Every dollar you paid to Mesa Group.\n\nMonthly Plans: Cancel Anytime After 90 Days\n\nFor monthly Mesa 360 plans (Lite, Flex, Elite), you can cancel at any time after the initial 90 days with no penalties or future charges. You only pay for work already completed.\n\nWhy This Guarantee Matters\n\nMost credit restoration companies don't offer this level of protection. We can make this guarantee because:\n\n•\nWe have a 91% success rate in removing or correcting negative items\n•\nOur Mesa 360 system uses proven legal strategies, not generic template letters\n•\nOur partnered legal team backs up our disputes when violations occur\n•\nWe've helped thousands of clients improve their credit scores (average 150-point increase)\n\nThe only way you don't see results is if you don't hold up your end—keeping monitoring active, staying responsive, and avoiding new negatives.\n\nIf you do your part, we deliver results or refund your investment.\n\nReady to start your credit transformation with zero risk?\n\nStart Your Risk-Free Credit Restoration\nEvery Month You Wait Costs You Money.\n\nRight now, you're paying penalties for bad credit:\n\nHigher interest on every loan\nSecurity deposits on rentals and utilities\nDenials for jobs, apartments, and financing\nStress, embarrassment, and limited options\n\nThe longer you wait, the more it costs you.

Mesa Group Consulting is a CROA-compliant financial services company operating in full accordance with federal consumer protection laws. We're not a fly-by-night operation—we're a real business with:\n\nA physical office in Bakersfield, CA that you can visit\n2,500+ clients served nationwide\n150+ five-star reviews from real customers\nFeatured in local media (KGET17, Studio17, Telemundo, The CW)\nFull legal team for FCRA violation cases\nTransparent pricing with no hidden fees\n\nWe're proud to serve clients in English, Spanish, and Punjabi (🇺🇸 🇪🇸 🇮🇳). You can call us, visit us, or read reviews from real people we've helped. We're as real as it gets.\n\n2. Will this hurt my credit more?\n\nNo. Legitimate credit disputes filed under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) cannot hurt your credit score. In fact, it's your legal right to dispute inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information on your credit report.\n\nHere's what happens when we dispute items:\n\nCredit bureaus investigate the item (they have 30 days to respond)\nIf the item cannot be verified, it must be removed\nIf it's verified as accurate, it stays on your report\nYour credit score is not penalized for disputing items\n\nWhat CAN hurt your credit:\n\nContinuing to miss payments on current accounts\nApplying for too much new credit during the process\nClosing old credit card accounts (reduces your credit age)\n\nThat's why our program includes 1-on-1 financial coaching—we teach you what to do AND what NOT to do while we're working on your disputes.\n\n3. How much is this going to cost total?\n\nWe believe in transparent pricing. Here's exactly what you'll pay:\n\nMonthly Plans:\n\nMesa360 Lite: $350 initial setup + $149/month (ongoing)\nMesa360 Flex: $500 initial setup + $199/month (ongoing)\nMesa360 Elite: $800 initial setup + $299/month (ongoing)\n\n12-Month Programs (Pay in Full & Save):\n\nRuby Plan: $1,500 one-time payment (saves you $888 vs. monthly Flex)\nEmerald Plan: $1,800 one-time payment (saves you $1,788 vs. monthly Elite)\n\nWhat's included in every plan:\n\n✅ Dedicated account manager\n✅ 1-on-1 financial coaching\n✅ Customized action plan\n✅ Monthly progress reports\n✅ Client portal + mobile app access\n✅ Ongoing support (monthly plans) or 12 months of service (prepaid plans)\n\nAdditional requirement: You must maintain a SmartCredit 3-Bureau monitoring account ($27.99/month after $1 for 7-day trial) throughout the entire process. This gives us—and you—real-time access to your credit reports from all three bureaus.\n\nNo hidden fees. No upsells. No surprises.\n\nYou can cancel your monthly plan anytime (we have a 3-day risk-free cancellation window from signup). The 12-month programs are paid in full but can be financed through Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) options.\n\n4. How long does it actually take to see results?\n\nMost clients see their first results within 45-90 days. However, timelines vary based on several factors:\n\nWhat affects your timeline:\n\nComplexity of your credit situation: Someone with 3 collections will see results faster than someone with bankruptcies, repos, and charge-offs\nCredit bureau responsiveness: Bureaus have 30 days to investigate disputes, but sometimes they respond sooner\nCreditor cooperation: Some creditors respond quickly; others require multiple rounds of disputes\nOngoing credit behavior: If you're still missing payments or adding new negative items, progress will be slower\n\nRealistic expectations:\n\nFirst 30-45 days: Initial disputes filed, first bureau responses received\n45-90 days: Most clients see first deletions and score improvements\n90-180 days: Significant progress; multiple rounds of disputes completed\n6-12 months: Most comprehensive results achieved\n\nWhat we guarantee: We cannot guarantee specific score increases or exact timelines—any company that does is violating federal law (CROA). What we CAN promise is a legally compliant, persistent dispute process with measurable progress tracking every step of the way.\n\nImportant note on monthly plans: Our monthly plans (Lite/Flex/Elite) provide ongoing support. If you add new items during the process, we'll work on them. This is different from our 12-month programs, which focus only on your credit profile at the time of enrollment.\n\n5. Can I do this myself instead of paying someone?\n\nYes—and we'll be the first to tell you that you have every legal right to dispute items yourself for free.\n\nBut here's the reality:\n\nWhy DIY often fails:\n\nCredit bureaus recognize generic templates: If you're using dispute letter templates from the internet, so are thousands of other people. Bureaus know these templates and often reject them automatically.\nIt's time-consuming: You'll spend hours researching laws, tracking responses, following up with multiple bureaus, and managing documentation.\nIt's confusing: Understanding FCRA, FDCPA, Metro 2 reporting, and creditor verification processes requires specialized knowledge.\nOne mistake can hurt you: Saying the wrong thing in a dispute letter can actually hurt your case or give bureaus ammunition to verify inaccurate items.\n\nWhat we bring to the table:\n\nPersonalized dispute strategies: No cookie-cutter templates—every letter is customized to your unique situation\nAdvanced methods: Digital uploads, Experian rapid inquiry removal, CFPB complaints, direct creditor disputes, Metro 2 challenges, and more\nFull legal team for violations: When bureaus or creditors violate your FCRA rights, we escalate with attorney support. Qualified clients have received settlements of $1,000–$2,500 for violations.\nOngoing coaching: We don't just dispute items—we teach you how to build and maintain good credit long-term\nIt's our full-time job: While you're working, spending time with family, or running your business, we're managing your disputes\n\nThink of it this way: You CAN change your own oil, fix your own plumbing, or file your own taxes. But most people hire professionals because the time, expertise, and peace of mind are worth it.\n\nStill want to try DIY first? We respect that. Download our free credit dispute letter template and give it a shot. If it works, great! If not, we're here when you're ready for professional help.\n\nADDITIONAL IMPORTANT QUESTIONS\n6. What items can be removed from my credit report?\n\nWe can dispute any item that is:\n\nInaccurate: Wrong account number, incorrect balance, belongs to someone else\nIncomplete: Missing required information under FCRA guidelines\nOutdated: Most negative items must be removed after 7 years (bankruptcies after 10 years)\nUnverifiable: If the creditor cannot verify the debt or provide proper documentation\n\nCommon items we successfully dispute:\n\n✅ Collections (medical, utility, credit card, etc.)\n✅ Late payments\n✅ Inquiries (hard pulls that weren't authorized)\n✅ Charge-offs\n✅ Bankruptcies (Chapter 7, Chapter 13)\n✅ Repossessions\n✅ Foreclosures\n✅ Evictions\n✅ Student loan defaults\n✅ Identity theft accounts\n✅ Accounts with inaccurate balances or payment history\n\nWhat we CANNOT remove:\n\n❌ Accurate, verifiable negative items (that would be illegal)\n❌ Current bankruptcies still within the 7-10 year reporting period if properly documented\n❌ Tax liens (these are public records)\n❌ Court judgments that are accurate and within reporting period\n\nOur approach: We follow consumer law, factual disputing principles, and FCRA/FDCPA regulations to help clients fix their credit ethically and legally. We don't promise to \"erase\" everything—we promise to challenge everything that's legally disputable and get results where creditors and bureaus can't verify their claims.\n\n7. Do you have legal support for FCRA violations?\n\nYes. While Mesa Group Consulting is not a law firm, we have a full legal team available for cases where creditors or credit bureaus violate your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) or Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).\n\nWhen legal escalation happens:\n\nA bureau fails to investigate your dispute within 30 days\nA creditor re-reports deleted information without proper verification\nA collector contacts you after being told to cease communication\nA bureau reports inaccurate information after you've provided proof of error\nAny other violation of federal consumer protection laws\n\nWhat legal support includes:\n\nParalegal FCRA/FDCPA audits of your case\nAttorney review and escalation letters\nLegal demand letters to creditors and bureaus\nSupport for potential violation claims\n\nSettlements: Many qualified clients have received settlements ranging from $1,000 to $2,500 (or more) when creditors or bureaus are found in violation of federal law. These settlements are in addition to the removal of inaccurate items.\n\nImportant note: Not every case qualifies for legal escalation—violations must be clear and documented. Your account manager will identify potential violations during your dispute process and escalate when appropriate.\n\n8. Do you work with all three credit bureaus?\n\nYes. We file disputes with all three major credit bureaus:\n\nExperian\nEquifax\nTransUnion\n\nWhy all three matter: Different lenders report to different bureaus. Your score can vary significantly between bureaus depending on what's reported. For example:\n\nYour mortgage lender might pull Equifax\nYour auto lender might pull Experian\nYour credit card company might pull TransUnion\n\nThat's why we dispute items across all three bureaus to ensure comprehensive coverage. When you apply for credit, you want clean reports everywhere.\n\nHow we access your reports: Through your SmartCredit 3-Bureau monitoring account, we (and you) get real-time access to your reports from all three bureaus. This allows us to:\n\nSee exactly what creditors are reporting\nTrack which disputes are successful\nIdentify new items that appear\nMonitor your score changes in real-time\n9. What happens if an item comes back 'verified'?\n\nIf a credit bureau verifies an item after our first dispute, that doesn't mean the process is over. Here's what happens next:\n\nRound 2: Advanced Dispute Methods\n\nWe request the \"method of verification\" (MOV) from the bureau—they must tell us HOW they verified it\nWe review the creditor's documentation for errors or missing information\nWe file a second dispute with additional evidence or a different angle of challenge\n\nRound 3: Direct Creditor Disputes\n\nWe bypass the bureau and go directly to the creditor/collector\nWe demand proof of the debt under FDCPA guidelines\nWe challenge reporting accuracy at the source\n\nRound 4: CFPB Complaints\n\nWe file complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)\nThis triggers a mandatory investigation and response from creditors/bureaus\nOften results in deletions when companies realize they lack proper documentation\n\nRound 5: Legal Review (If Applicable)\n\nIf we identify FCRA violations, we escalate to our legal team\nAttorney escalation letters often result in removal to avoid legal liability\n\nPersistence pays off: Many items that are initially \"verified\" are eventually removed on subsequent rounds. Why? Because:\n\nCreditors often don't have complete documentation\nBureaus and creditors hope you'll give up after one attempt\nEach dispute round forces them to re-verify—and they often can't\n\nClient example: Sarah had a $4,200 medical collection verified twice. On the third dispute, we went directly to the collection agency and demanded documentation under FDCPA. They couldn't provide itemized medical records (HIPAA privacy protection), so they deleted it.\n\n10. Can you guarantee my score will increase by X points?\n\nNo—and you should run from any company that makes that promise.\n\nUnder the Credit Repair Organizations Act (CROA), it is illegal for credit restoration companies to:\n\nGuarantee specific score increases\nPromise removal of accurate negative items\nCharge upfront fees before work is performed (we comply with this through our $0 due today model with 3-day cancellation window)\n\nWhat we CAN promise:\n\n✅ A legally compliant, personalized dispute process\n✅ Persistent challenges to inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable items\n✅ Measurable progress tracking with monthly reports\n✅ 1-on-1 coaching to build positive credit during the process\n✅ Full legal team support for FCRA violations\n✅ Transparency every step of the way\n\nWhy we can't guarantee specific results:\n\nWe don't control how creditors and bureaus respond\nYour score depends on multiple factors (payment history, utilization, credit age, etc.)\nEveryone's credit situation is unique\n\nWhat we CAN show you: Real results from real clients:\n\nSarah: 540 → 695 in 75 days (6 collections removed)\nCarlos: 520s → 100+ point increase in under 4 months\nMaria: 580 → 710 in 9 months (included charge-offs and late payments)\n\nResults may vary. Individual timelines and outcomes depend on the complexity of your credit situation.\n\n11. What's included in the 1-on-1 financial coaching?\n\nEvery Mesa Group client—regardless of which plan you choose—gets a dedicated account manager and personalized financial coaching. This isn't just credit restoration; it's a complete financial transformation program.\n\nYour coaching includes:\n\n📊 Customized Action Plan\n\nReview of your current credit situation\nIdentification of all disputable items\nStrategy for building positive credit during the process\nTimeline expectations based on your unique situation\n\n👤 Dedicated Account Manager\n\nReal person assigned to your case (no switching between random reps)\nDirect phone and email access\nTrilingual support available (🇺🇸 English | 🇪🇸 Español | 🇮🇳 Punjabi)\nThey know your name, your story, and your goals\n\n📈 Monthly Progress Reviews\n\nDetailed updates on dispute progress\nExplanation of what's working and what's not\nStrategy adjustments as needed\nScore change analysis\n\n🎯 Credit Building Education\n\nHow to use credit cards responsibly (utilization ratios, payment timing)\nWhen to apply for new credit (and when NOT to)\nBuilding positive payment history\nUnderstanding credit mix and account age\nProtecting your credit long-term\n\n💡 Ongoing Support\n\nQuestions answered throughout the process\nGuidance on major financial decisions (buying a car, applying for a mortgage)\nHelp understanding credit bureau responses\nSupport beyond just the disputes\n\nWhy coaching matters: Removing negative items is only half the battle. Without learning how to build and maintain good credit, you'll end up back where you started. Our clients don't just see score increases—they achieve lasting financial transformation.\n\n\"I came to Mesa Group with a 540 score and collections I didn't understand. My account manager, Maria, didn't just file disputes—she explained every step, taught me how credit utilization works, and helped me build a plan to keep my score high after the program. Nine months later, I'm at 710 and I finally understand how to manage my credit.\"\n\n— Carlos R., Bakersfield, CA\n\n12. What's the difference between your monthly plans and 12-month programs?\n\nGreat question—we offer both options to fit different needs and budgets.\n\nMONTHLY PLANS (Lite, Flex, Elite) - BEST FOR FLEXIBILITY\n\nStructure:\n\nInitial setup fee ($350-$800 depending on plan)\nOngoing monthly fee ($149-$299 depending on plan)\nCancel anytime (after 3-day risk-free window)\n\nKey Advantage: ✅ Ongoing support for new items—If you add new negative items during the process (like a late payment or new collection), we'll work on them. No additional charge.\n\nWhy this matters: Life happens. Despite our coaching and guidance, clients sometimes add new late payments or inquiries during the credit recovery process. Monthly plans keep you covered and accountable—we don't abandon your case when new challenges arise. This flexibility is worth the ongoing investment for clients with active or evolving credit situations.\n\nBest for:\n\nPeople who want maximum flexibility\nActive credit situations (still working on paying down debts, applying for credit)\nThose who prefer to pay as they go\nClients who want ongoing support as long as needed\n\n12-MONTH PROGRAMS (Ruby, Emerald) - BEST FOR SAVINGS\n\nStructure:\n\nOne-time payment ($1,500 for Ruby, $1,800 for Emerald)\nCan be paid in full OR financed through Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)\nFull 12 months of service\n\nKey Advantage: ✅ Significant savings—Save $888 (Ruby) or $1,788 (Emerald) vs. paying monthly\n\nImportant Note: ❌ Comprehensive 12-month program focused on your current credit profile at enrollment. New items added during the program will NOT be worked on.\n\nBest for:\n\nPeople who want to save money upfront\nStable credit situations (no new negatives expected)\nClients committed to a full year of service\nThose who prefer one-and-done payment\n\nWhich plan is right for you?\n\nChoose Monthly Plans if:\n\nYou want flexibility to cancel anytime\nYour credit situation is still evolving\nYou want support for new items as they appear\nYou prefer to pay as you go\n\nChoose 12-Month Programs if:\n\nYou want to save money (up to $1,788)\nYour credit situation is stable\nYou're committed to a full year\nYou prefer to pay once and be done\n\nStill not sure?

What happens after my credit is restored?\n\nOur goal isn't just to fix your credit—it's to transform your financial future. Here's what happens:\n\nDuring the Program:\n\nWe remove inaccurate items\nYou learn credit building strategies through coaching\nYour score improves steadily\nYou start getting approved for better credit products\n\nAfter Major Items Are Removed:\n\nMonthly plan clients: You can continue service as long as you want ongoing support, or you can cancel anytime\n12-month program clients: You complete your full year of service with continued monitoring and coaching\nWe provide a \"credit maintenance\" guide with long-term strategies\n\nYour next steps:\n\n🏠 Apply for that mortgage you've been denied for\n🚗 Get approved for a car loan with reasonable rates\n💳 Access better credit cards with rewards and lower APRs\n💼 Secure business funding if you're an entrepreneur\n🎓 Refinance student loans at lower interest rates\n\nOngoing support (if needed):\n\nMany clients stay with us on monthly plans even after major clean-up work is done because:\n\nThey want ongoing monitoring and coaching\nThey like having an account manager to call with questions\nThey continue applying for new accounts and want guidance\nThey want protection if new items appear\n\nYou're in control: There's no pressure to stay or leave. When you feel confident managing your credit independently, you're free to cancel (monthly plans) or you'll complete your 12-month term (prepaid plans) and graduate from the program.\n\nOur success = your success: When you close on a house, buy your dream car, or secure that business loan, that's what it's all about. We're here to make that happen.\n\n16. What is SmartCredit and why do I need it?\n\nSmartCredit is a credit monitoring service that provides real-time access to your credit reports from all three bureaus (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion). It's a required tool for our program.\n\nWhy it's required:\n\n📊 Real-Time Access\n\nWe need to see your actual credit reports to file accurate disputes\nYou get to track your progress in real-time\nBoth you and your account manager see the same information\n\n🔍 3-Bureau Coverage\n\nMost free credit monitoring (like Credit Karma) only shows Vantage Scores, which lenders don't use\nSmartCredit shows FICO scores, which are what mortgage, auto, and credit card lenders actually pull\nCovers all three bureaus, not just one or two\n\n⚡ Updates Fast\n\nWhen items are removed, you see it within days\nAlerts you to new items or changes immediately\nCritical for tracking dispute effectiveness\n\nCost:\n\n$1 for 7-day trial\nThen $27.99/month after trial ends\nYou must maintain this throughout your program\n\nWhy we don't include it in our price:\n\nSmartCredit is a third-party service (not owned by Mesa Group)\nYou maintain direct control over your account\nYou can cancel SmartCredit separately if you leave our program\n\nAfter your program:\n\nMany clients choose to keep SmartCredit even after completing credit recovery because it's valuable for:\n\nOngoing monitoring\nIdentity theft protection\nTracking your continued credit building\n17. Can I apply for new credit during the program?\n\nYes, but strategically.\n\nThis is one of the most important topics we cover in your 1-on-1 coaching, because applying for new credit during credit rebuilding can either help or hurt—depending on timing and approach.\n\nGeneral guidance:\n\n✅ GOOD IDEAS:\n\nSecured credit cards: These report positive payment history and help build credit with minimal risk\nCredit builder loans: Specifically designed to help build credit\nBecoming an authorized user: On someone else's account with good payment history\nApplying for credit AFTER major removals: Once your score improves, your approval odds increase\n\n❌ BAD IDEAS:\n\nApplying for multiple cards at once: Hard inquiries can temporarily lower your score\nApplying right before buying a house/car: Lenders want stable credit for 6+ months before major purchases\nOpening store credit cards impulsively: Just because you get approved doesn't mean you should say yes\nTaking on debt you can't afford: New credit is only helpful if you manage it responsibly\n\nOur approach: Your account manager will create a personalized credit building strategy that includes:\n\nWhen to apply for new credit (timing matters)\nWhat types of credit to apply for\nHow to keep utilization low on new accounts\nBuilding positive payment history while we remove negative items\n\nExample strategy:\n\nMonths 1-2: Focus on disputes only; avoid new applications\nMonth 3: Apply for secured credit card after first removals boost your score\nMonths 4-6: Use secured card responsibly (under 10% utilization, pay in full monthly)\nMonth 6+: Consider additional credit building based on your goals\n\nMonthly plan advantage: If you're on a monthly plan with ongoing support for new items, we'll work on any new inquiries or accounts that appear during the process.\n\nBottom line: Yes, you can apply for credit—but let's be strategic about it. That's what the coaching is for.\n\n18. What's your refund policy?\n\n90 Days. Real Results. Or You Get Every Dollar Back.\n\nWe don't just talk about results—we put it in writing.\n\nEvery Mesa Group client is protected by The Mesa360 Guarantee: a legally written, contract-backed 90-Day Money-Back Promise that most credit service companies aren't confident enough to offer.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nIf you hold up your end of the agreement and we don't deliver real, verifiable progress within the first 90 days, you get 100% of your money back. No excuses. No runaround. No fine print.\n\nYour Responsibilities (What \"Holding Up Your End\" Means):\n\nTo qualify for the guarantee, you must:\n\n✅ Keep SmartCredit Active: Maintain your 3-bureau monitoring throughout the 90 days (we need real-time access to your reports to work effectively). If your SmartCredit account is inactive for more than 30 days, you become ineligible for the guarantee.\n✅ Stay Responsive: Respond to your account manager's requests for information or documentation. If you become unresponsive for more than 30 days, we can no longer service your account and the guarantee becomes void.\n✅ Keep Your Account Current: Maintain payment on your Mesa Group account. Unpaid invoices for more than 30 days result in service suspension and guarantee ineligibility.\n✅ Avoid New Negative Items: Don't add new late payments, collections, or charge-offs during the 90-day period (new negatives work against the progress we're making)\n✅ Avoid New Hard Inquiries: Don't apply for multiple new credit accounts during the initial dispute period (this can temporarily lower your score and complicate the process)\n✅ Follow Your Account Manager's Guidance: Your 1-on-1 coaching includes strategic advice—following it matters\n\nOur Guarantee:\n\nIf you meet all those conditions and we don't remove at least 1 verifiable negative item from your credit report within 90 days, you qualify for a full refund of all fees paid to Mesa Group.\n\nImportant clarification:\n\n\"Results\" means documented removal of at least 1 inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable item\nWe cannot guarantee specific score increases (that would violate CROA regulations)\nMost clients see multiple removals within 90 days—this is a conservative baseline\n\nWhy We Can Offer This:\n\nMost of our clients start seeing results in the first 30-45 days. Why? Because we work your file like our reputation depends on it—because it does.\n\nYour case doesn't sit in a queue collecting dust\nYour dedicated account manager is personally invested in your success\nWe use advanced dispute methods, not cookie-cutter templates\nWhen violations occur, our legal team escalates\n\nWe're that confident in our process.\n\n19. What are the cancellation terms and guarantee exclusions?\n\nWhat's NOT Covered by the Guarantee:\n\n❌ SmartCredit subscription fees (that's a third-party service you control)\n❌ Inactive SmartCredit account (if your CMS is inactive for more than 30 days, we can't work on your case)\n❌ Unpaid invoices (if your Mesa Group account has unpaid invoices for more than 30 days, service is suspended)\n❌ Unresponsive clients (if you don't respond to communications for more than 30 days, we can no longer service your account)\n❌ New negative items you add during the process (late payments, collections, inquiries)\n\n3-Day Risk-Free Cancellation Window (All Plans):\n\nIn addition to the 90-Day Guarantee, you also get:\n\n3-day cancellation window from signup date\nFull refund if you cancel within 3 days for any reason\nNo questions asked, no hassle\n\nAfter the 90-Day Period:\n\nMonthly Plans (Lite, Flex, Elite):\n\nYou can cancel anytime after the 90-day guarantee period\nNo refund on work already completed, but no further charges\nNo cancellation fees or penalties\n\n12-Month Programs (Ruby, Emerald):\n\nRefunds after the 90-day guarantee window are evaluated case-by-case based on work completed\nThese are prepaid programs, so the 90-day guarantee is your primary protection\n\nYou've Got Nothing to Lose. Everything to Gain.\n\nIf you're serious about transforming your credit and your financial future, we'll match your commitment with everything we've got.\n\n✨ This is The Mesa360 Guarantee.\nReal Results in 90 Days — or Your Money Back.\n\nQuestions about the guarantee?\n\n📞 Call us: (661) 310-3040\n📧 Email: contact@mesagroupconsulting.com\n🏢 Visit us: 5001 California Ave Suite 219, Bakersfield, CA 93309\n\n20. Will you help me with identity theft?\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\nIdentity theft accounts (fraudulent accounts opened in your name) are some of the most damaging items that can appear on your credit report—and they're 100% disputable since they're not your responsibility.\n\nWhat we do:\n\n🚨 Identify Fraudulent Accounts\n\nReview your credit report for accounts you don't recognize\nLook for addresses you've never lived at\nSpot inquiries you didn't authorize\nFind patterns consistent with identity theft\n\n📋 File Identity Theft Reports\n\nGuide you through filing a report with the FTC (IdentityTheft.gov)\nHelp you file a police report (required for many disputes)\nDocument everything for credit bureau disputes\n\n💼 Dispute Fraudulent Accounts\n\nFile disputes with all three bureaus\nSubmit identity theft affidavits\nProvide police reports and FTC documentation\nEscalate to legal team if bureaus don't comply\n\n🛡️ Protect Your Credit Going Forward\n\nSet up fraud alerts on your credit reports\nGuide you through credit freezes (if appropriate)\nMonitor for new fraudulent activity through SmartCredit\n\nImportant distinction:\n\nIdentity theft disputes: These are typically resolved faster because you have documentation proving fraud\nRegular disputes: These challenge inaccurate or unverifiable items that may be yours but were misreported\n\nClient example: Juan discovered 4 credit cards on his report that he never opened, totaling $18,000 in fraudulent charges. We helped him file FTC and police reports, disputed all four accounts, and had them removed within 60 days.

We walk you through every step with video tutorials, tooltips, and simple instructions. Most people complete their first dispute letter in under 15 minutes.\n\nHow much time will this take per month?\n\nPlan on 2-3 hours per month. Initial setup (importing reports, reviewing items) takes about 2 hours. After that, it's 30-60 minutes monthly to send disputes, track responses, and update your reports. Compare this to full-service credit repair which takes 0 hours but costs $149-449/month.\n\nWhat's the difference between this and free DIY credit repair?\n\nFree DIY means writing your own letters from scratch, creating Excel spreadsheets to track everything, and figuring out strategy yourself. Our software gives you AI-powered recommendations, professional letter templates, 3-bureau tracking, deadline management, and education—everything credit repair companies use. You save hundreds while getting professional tools.\n\nCan I really dispute as many items as I want?\n\nYes. Whether you have 1 negative item or 50, the price is the same. Dispute all of them, re-dispute verified items with different strategies, send multiple rounds—unlimited. This is why DIY saves so much money compared to services that charge per-item or per-dispute.\n\nWhat if I get stuck or have questions?\n\nWe provide email support from real credit repair experts. Typically respond within 24 hours on business days. Plus, our education library has tutorials, sample disputes, and step-by-step guides for common situations. You're never truly on your own.\n\nWill bureaus take my disputes seriously?\n\nYes, IF you use proper dispute letters. That's exactly what our letter generator creates—professional, legally-compliant disputes that cite specific FCRA violations, Metro 2 errors, and debt validation requirements. Bureaus are REQUIRED by federal law to investigate all disputes, whether they come from you or a credit repair company.\n\nHow long until I see results?\n\nBureaus have 30 days to respond to disputes. Most people see their first deletions within 45-60 days. Significant score improvements (50+ points) typically happen within 3-6 months as multiple items are removed. Timeline depends on how many items you're disputing and how quickly bureaus respond.\n\nWhat if I'm not satisfied?\n\nWe offer a 7-day free trial (no credit card required) and a 30-day money-back guarantee after you subscribe. If the software isn't what you expected, cancel within 30 days for a full refund. We want you to succeed, not feel trapped.\n\nCan I upgrade to MESA 360 coaching later?\n\nAbsolutely. If you try DIY and realize it's not for you, we can transition you to our MESA 360 financial coaching team at any time. Many clients start with DIY to save money, then upgrade if their situation becomes more complex. We're here to help either way.\n\nPeople Like You Are Doing It Themselves\n\nNo credit repair company. No thousands in fees. Just the right tools and the drive to take control. Creditily users are saving money and fixing their credit — on their own terms.\n\nWhat Creditily Users Are Saying\n5\nStars\nRated on Google\n$1,000s\nSaved\nvs. credit repair companies\n100%\nControl\nYou run the process\n\nReal people.

We've partnered with proven tools to help you build strong credit relationships—no guesswork, no wasted time, just a clear path to funding.\n\nSchedule Your Free Consultation\nSpeak with a Specialist: (661) 310-3040\n2,500+ Clients Guided\nRecognized by SmartCredit for Empowering Consumers\nTrusted by Leading Financial Platforms\nCredit Is About Relationships, Not Just Numbers\n\nMost people think credit is just about hitting a score. They obsess over three digits, constantly refreshing their credit apps, hoping their number magically jumps high enough to qualify for something.\n\nThat's the wrong approach.\n\nCredit isn't a game you hack. It's a relationship system between you and financial institutions. Banks, credit unions, and lenders want to see one thing: Are you someone they can trust with their money?\n\nAnd trust isn't built overnight. It's built through:\n\nConsistency\n\nShowing up every month with on-time payments\n\nResponsibility\n\nManaging different types of credit without maxing out\n\nHistory\n\nDemonstrating you've been reliable over time\n\nDiversity\n\nProving you can handle both revolving credit and installment loans\n\n\"You can have a 750 credit score and still get denied. Someone with a 680 and relationships gets approved. This is the power of relationships.\"\n\nYou Can't Get Credit Without Credit History\n\nIt's the ultimate catch-22.\n\nYou walk into a car dealership. You've never missed a payment in your life. You have $5,000 saved for a down payment. You've been at your job for 3 years.\n\nThe salesperson runs your credit.\n\n\"I'm sorry, we can't approve you today. Your credit file is too thin.\"\n\nBecause lenders don't just want a clean report. They want to see proof that you can handle credit responsibly. And if you've never had credit—or if you recently removed all your negative accounts—you're essentially invisible to them.\n\nScenario 1: The Thin File Problem\n\nYou have maybe one credit card you opened a year ago. You pay it on time every month. But when you apply for a car loan, you get denied—not because of bad behavior, but because lenders can't see enough history to trust you.\n\nScenario 2: The \"Clean Slate\" Problem\n\nYou just finished credit restoration. All the negatives are gone. Your report is clean. But clean isn't fundable. With no positive accounts reporting, you're essentially starting from scratch.\n\nScenario 3: The \"New Credit\" Problem\n\nYou opened 3 credit cards last month hoping to build credit fast. Instead, your score dropped 40 points. Too many hard inquiries. No account age. Lenders now see you as risky.\n\nSame Starting Point. Different Strategy. Completely Different Outcome.\nPerson A (Didn't Follow This Guide)\nOpens 5 random credit cards in one month\nScore drops 60 points from hard inquiries\nGets denied for an apartment because of \"too many recent accounts\"\nMaxes out 2 cards trying to build utilization\nCloses old accounts because \"they're not using them\"\n12 months later: 580 score, no lending relationships, frustration\nPerson B (Followed This Guide)\nStarts with 1 credit union secured card + 1 credit builder loan\nOpens accounts strategically, 60+ days apart\nKeeps utilization under 10% on every account\nAdds rent reporting to backdate 24 months of payment history\nAfter 6 months, adds 2 more revolving accounts strategically\n12 months later: 720+ score, credit union relationship, auto loan pre-approval, $15K available credit\n\nThe difference? Person B understood that credit building isn't about finding a magic product. It's about strategic relationships and timing.\n\nYou're about to become Person B.\n\nCredit Building = Adding Positive Accounts That Lenders Actually Want to See\n\nCredit building means strategically opening accounts that report positive payment history to the credit bureaus. These accounts create the \"credit depth\" that lenders need to see before approving you for major purchases.\n\nPillar 1\nCredit Union Relationships\n\nCredit unions are member-owned, which means they're designed to help you succeed—not just profit from fees. When you open a secured card or credit builder account at a credit union, you're building a relationship that leads to future auto loans, personal loans, and eventually mortgages.\n\nThe Goal: Establish at least one credit union membership with an active account.\n\nPillar 2\nRevolving Credit\n\nThese are credit cards and lines of credit where you can borrow, repay, and borrow again. Lenders want to see that you can manage available credit responsibly without maxing it out.\n\nThe Goal: 3-5 revolving accounts with combined credit limits of $10,000+ and utilization under 10%.\n\nPillar 3\nInstallment Credit\n\nThese are fixed loans with set payment amounts over time—like auto loans, mortgages, or credit builder loans. Having installment credit shows lenders you can commit to regular payments.\n\nThe Goal: 1-2 installment accounts showing consistent on-time payments.\n\nPillar 4\nAccount Age & Payment History\n\nThe longer your accounts have been open with positive payment history, the more trustworthy you appear. This is why closing old accounts or opening too many new ones can hurt you.\n\nThe Goal: Average account age of 2+ years with zero late payments.\n\nPillar 5\nCredit Mix & Diversity\n\nLenders like seeing that you can manage different types of credit. Having only credit cards or only loans limits what they can assess about your financial responsibility.\n\nThe Goal: A mix of revolving and installment accounts demonstrating financial versatility.\n\nYour Credit Building Journey in 3 Steps\n1\nChoose Your Tools\n\nBased on your starting point, select the credit building accounts that make sense. Not everyone needs the same combination. Someone with zero credit history needs different tools than someone who just finished credit restoration.\n\nPick 3-5 accounts across different categories:\n\n2-3 revolving accounts (credit builders or secured cards)\n1-2 installment accounts (credit builder loans)\n1 rent reporting service (optional but recommended)\n\nWe help you choose the right combination for your situation.\n\n2\nOpen Accounts Strategically\n\nTiming matters. Opening too many accounts at once triggers hard inquiries and signals desperation to lenders. The 60-Day Rule: Space new account applications at least 60 days apart to minimize score impact and avoid triggering \"too many recent accounts\" flags.\n\nTimeline:\n\nMonth 1: Foundation accounts\nMonth 3-4: Secondary accounts\nMonth 6+: Strategic additions\n3\nMake On-Time Payments & Watch Your Profile Grow\n\nEvery on-time payment builds trust. Every month of responsible behavior strengthens your file. This isn't a hack—it's a system. And systems work when you work them consistently.\n\nResults:\n\nCredit score increases\nCredit limits increase\nInterest rates decrease\nApproval odds increase\nReady to Get Started?

Testimonials reflect individual experiences and are not a guarantee of similar outcomes.\n\nBeyond the Score: Building Institutional Relationships\n\nYou can have a 750 credit score and still get denied for a mortgage. Why? Because the lender has never seen your name before. You have no relationship with them. No history. No trust.\n\nBut someone with a 680 who's been banking at the same credit union for 5 years, paid off a car loan through them, and has a checking account? They're getting approved—often with better terms.\n\n\"Credit scores are just the entry ticket. Relationships are what get you approved.\"\n\nYour 5-Year Credit Journey\nYear 1\nFoundation Set\n\nCredit union relationship established, 3-5 tradelines, 700+ score potential\n\nYear 3\nRelationship Growth\n\nAuto loan paid/paying, personal loan access, $20K+ available credit\n\nYear 5\nPremium Access\n\nMortgage approved with competitive rates, $50K+ credit access, business funding opportunities\n\n5 Mistakes That Cost People Months of Progress\nMistake #1: Opening Too Many Accounts at Once\n\nWhy It Hurts: Each application creates a hard inquiry. Multiple inquiries in a short period signals desperation to lenders and drops your score. \"Too many recent accounts\" is a common denial reason.\n\nThe Fix: Space applications 60+ days apart. Start with 1-2 accounts and build gradually.\n\nMistake #2: Skipping the Credit Union\n\nWhy It Hurts: Banks and credit card companies don't build relationships—they build profits. Credit unions are designed to help members succeed and will approve you for future loans based on your membership history.\n\nThe Fix: Start with a credit union secured card or credit builder. Build the relationship first.\n\nMistake #3: Maxing Out New Accounts\n\nWhy It Hurts: High utilization (using more than 30% of your limit) signals financial stress. Even paying it off monthly, high reported balances hurt your score.\n\nThe Fix: Keep utilization under 10% on every account. Pay balances before statement closes.\n\nMistake #4: Missing Payments\n\nWhy It Hurts: One late payment can drop your score 50-100 points and stays on your report for 7 years. Payment history is 35% of your credit score—the single biggest factor.\n\nThe Fix: Set up autopay for at least minimum payments. Never miss. Ever.\n\nMistake #5: Closing Old Accounts\n\nWhy It Hurts: Closing accounts reduces your available credit (increasing utilization) and eventually removes account age from your profile. Both hurt your score.\n\nThe Fix: Keep old accounts open, even if unused. Use them occasionally to keep them active.\n\nAlready Working on Credit Restoration?

It's a reputation you build.

After your 7-day trial, SmartCredit continues at $27.99 per month. This includes daily credit monitoring from all 3 bureaus, real-time alerts for changes to your credit, credit score tracking and analysis, and identity theft protection features. You can cancel anytime with no long-term commitment required.\n\nWhy do I need to monitor all 3 credit bureaus?\n\nEach credit bureau (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) maintains separate records. One bureau may have more or fewer inquiries than the others, which could produce different credit reports and scores. Monitoring all three ensures you have a comprehensive view of your credit and can quickly identify discrepancies.\n\nHow often is my credit information updated?\n\nYour credit reports are updated monthly, and you'll receive real-time alerts whenever changes occur to your credit profile. This includes new accounts, inquiries, late payments, or suspicious activity.\n\nWill checking my credit hurt my score?\n\nNo. When you check your own credit through SmartCredit®, it's considered a \"soft inquiry\" which does not impact your credit score. Only \"hard inquiries\" from lenders when you apply for credit can affect your score.\n\nWhat's included in the $1 Million fraud insurance?\n\nThe Identity Fraud Expense Reimbursement covers expenses related to identity theft for you and your entire household. This includes legal fees, lost wages, document replacement costs, and other expenses incurred while resolving identity theft issues.\n\nCan I cancel anytime?\n\nYes. You can cancel your SmartCredit® membership at any time with no penalties or fees. You'll pay any accumulated, unbilled charges through the date of cancellation. You may reactivate your membership at any time.\n\nHow do I dispute errors on my credit report?\n\nSmartCredit® makes disputing errors simple with Action Buttons built into your credit report dashboard. When you identify an error, click the Action Button to communicate directly with the creditor or credit bureau to initiate the dispute process.\n\n3-Bureau Credit Monitoring\n$1 Million Fraud Insurance\n24/7 Real-Time Alerts\nDark Web Monitoring\nScore Simulator Tools\nEasy Dispute Action Buttons\nCancel Anytime\nTrusted by Professionals\nStart Protecting Your Credit Today\n\n$1 gets you started with a 7-day trial of full 3-bureau credit monitoring.\nContinue at $27.99/month after trial.

The hard pull happens here—not during comparison.\n\nImportant: Soft Pull vs. Hard Pull\n\nSoft Pull (Pre-Qualification): Doesn't affect your credit score. This is what happens when you compare cards.\n\nHard Pull (Application): May lower your score by 5-10 points temporarily. This only happens when you actually apply for a card.\n\nTired of Seeing \"DECLINED\" While Everyone Else Earns Rewards on Every Purchase?\n\nAnother rejection.

Here's what actually matters:\n\nAPR (Interest Rate)\n\nThe rate you pay on unpaid balances. Lower is always better.\n\nRange: 15.99% - 29.99%. Excellent credit gets lowest rates.\n\nAnnual Fee\n\nYearly cost to keep the card. $0 - $695+.\n\nPremium cards charge fees but offer valuable perks. Do the math.\n\nRewards Rate\n\nCashback percentage or points per dollar spent.\n\nTypical: 1-2% base, 3-5% in bonus categories. Check the fine print.\n\nSign-Up Bonus\n\nOne-time reward for hitting spending threshold.\n\nExample: \"Spend $3K in 3 months, get $200.\" Factor in your budget.\n\nForeign Transaction Fee\n\nCharge for purchases outside the US (typically 3%).\n\nIf you travel internationally, look for $0 foreign fees.\n\nCredit Limit\n\nMaximum you can charge. Affects utilization ratio.\n\nHigher limits = better utilization = higher credit score.\n\nPicture Your Credit Score Rising. See Yourself Getting Approved. Imagine Earning Rewards Again.\n\nImagine checking your credit score next month—watching it climb. Getting approved for that premium card. Earning 3% cash back on groceries. Booking flights with points you earned. That financial confidence you deserve is one decision away.\n\nStart Building Your Credit Future →\nPowered by\nCommon Credit Card Questions\n\nGet answers to common questions about credit cards and pre-qualification.\n\nWill checking my pre-qualification hurt my credit score?\n\nNo. Pre-qualification uses a 'soft pull' which doesn't affect your credit score at all. Soft pulls are visible only to you, not to lenders. Only when you actually APPLY for a card (after pre-qualification) does a hard pull happen, which may lower your score by 5-10 points temporarily.\n\nWhat's the difference between pre-qualification and pre-approval?\n\nPre-qualification is a quick estimate based on self-reported info (soft pull, no score impact). Pre-approval is more thorough, often involves a hard pull, and means you're very likely to be approved. Our tool shows pre-qualification first—apply when ready for the hard pull.\n\nWhat credit score do I need to get approved?\n\nIt depends on the card. Secured cards accept 300+ scores. Standard cards want 580-669 (fair credit). Rewards cards prefer 670+ (good credit). Premium travel cards need 740+ (excellent). Our comparison tool shows you which cards match YOUR score range.\n\nShould I close old credit cards I don't use?\n\nUsually no. Closing old cards reduces your total available credit (increases utilization) and shortens your credit history—both hurt your score. Better strategy: Keep old cards open, use them occasionally for small purchases, pay off immediately.\n\nHow many credit cards should I have?\n\nThere's no magic number, but most credit experts recommend 2-4 cards for optimal credit building. Multiple cards increase total credit limit (lowers utilization), provides backup options, and can maximize rewards in different categories. Just don't apply for many at once.\n\nWhat if I get denied after applying?\n\nCall the issuer's reconsideration line within 30 days and ask why you were denied. Sometimes you can provide additional info (income proof, explanation of credit issues) and get approved. If not, wait 6 months, improve your credit, and try again or apply for a different card.\n\nCan I get a credit card with no credit history?\n\nYes. Start with a secured credit card (requires deposit) or become an authorized user on someone else's card. Student cards and credit builder cards also work. After 6-12 months of on-time payments, you'll qualify for standard unsecured cards.\n\nHow do I maximize credit card rewards?\n\nStrategy: (1) Use cards in their bonus categories (5% on gas, 3% on dining, etc.), (2) Pay off balance monthly to avoid interest (which wipes out rewards), (3) Take advantage of sign-up bonuses, (4) Consider a 2% flat cashback card for everything else.\n\nCredit Score Ranges & What They Mean\n\nYour credit score determines which cards you qualify for. Here's the breakdown:\n\n800 - 850\nExceptional\n\nBest rates on everything. Premium cards welcome you.\n\n740 - 799\nVery Good\n\nGreat rates. Most premium cards available.\n\n670 - 739\nGood\n\nAbove-average rates. Solid rewards cards accessible.\n\n580 - 669\nFair\n\nHigher rates. Limited to rebuilding cards.\n\n300 - 579\nPoor\n\nSecured cards only. Focus on rebuilding.\n\nDon't Know Your Credit Score?\n\nOur comparison tool will estimate your score range based on your credit profile. Or check your score free at Credit Karma, Experian, or through your bank.\n\nFind Cards for Your Score\nPowered by\n50+ Cards to Compare\nNo Credit Score Impact\nSee Approval Odds\nAll Credit Levels\n60-Second Process\nCash Back Options\nTravel Rewards\nCredit Building Cards\nReady to Find Your Perfect Credit Card?\nCompare Credit Cards Now →\n\nOr call us: (661) 310-3040\n\nPowered by\n\nHave a question about credit, funding, or your next financial move?

Take control today and watch your stress transform into confidence.\n\nStart Your Journey Now →\nPowered by\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nGet answers to common questions about personal loans and our comparison service.\n\nWill checking rates affect my credit score?\n\nNo! When you check rates through our platform, we only use a soft credit inquiry, which does not impact your credit score. Only when you formally apply with a specific lender will they perform a hard credit pull—and only after you've chosen to proceed.\n\nHow fast can I get funded?\n\nOnce approved by a lender, funds are typically deposited into your bank account within 1-3 business days. Some lenders offer same-day or next-day funding for an additional fee. The overall timeline from application to funding is usually 2-5 business days.\n\nWhat credit score do I need to qualify?\n\nWhile many lenders prefer credit scores of 640+, our network includes lenders who work with scores as low as 580 or even lower. Your credit score affects your interest rate more than your approval odds. Better credit typically means lower rates.\n\nCan I use a personal loan for any purpose?\n\nYes! Personal loans are unsecured and can be used for almost any legal purpose—debt consolidation, home improvements, medical bills, major purchases, business expenses, education, and more. Some lenders may ask what you'll use the funds for, but there are no restrictions.\n\nWhat's the difference between a personal loan and a credit card?\n\nPersonal loans provide a lump sum with fixed monthly payments over a set term (e.g., 36 months), typically at lower interest rates than credit cards. Credit cards are revolving credit with variable payments and higher APRs. For large expenses or debt consolidation, personal loans usually save more money.\n\nAre there any fees I should know about?\n\nSome lenders charge an origination fee (typically 1-6% of the loan amount), which is deducted from your loan proceeds. Other potential fees include late payment fees and failed payment fees. Many lenders do not charge prepayment penalties, allowing you to pay off your loan early without penalty. Always review the loan terms before accepting an offer.\n\nHow much can I borrow?\n\nLoan amounts in our network range from $1,000 to $100,000, depending on the lender and your qualifications. Most borrowers qualify for $5,000 to $35,000. Your approved amount depends on your income, credit score, existing debts, and the lender's criteria.\n\nWhat documents will I need to apply?\n\nTypically, you'll need: proof of identity (driver's license or state ID), proof of income (recent pay stubs, W-2s, or bank statements), Social Security Number, proof of address, and bank account information. Self-employed applicants may need tax returns or additional documentation.\n\nCan I pay off my loan early?\n\nMost lenders in our network allow early payoff without penalties, which can save you money on interest. However, some lenders do charge prepayment penalties, so always check the loan terms before accepting an offer.\n\nWhat happens if I miss a payment?\n\nMissing a payment can result in late fees (typically $15-$30) and negative marks on your credit report if the payment is more than 30 days late. If you're struggling to make payments, contact your lender immediately—many offer hardship programs or payment arrangements.\n\nIs Mesa Group Consulting a lender?\n\nNo, Mesa Group Consulting is not a lender. We are a financial services marketplace that connects consumers with multiple lending partners. We do not make lending decisions or fund loans—we simply help you compare offers from our network of trusted lenders.\n\nHow do you make money if the service is free?\n\nOur service is free for consumers. We earn a referral fee from lenders when you successfully complete a loan through our platform. This does not affect your interest rate or loan terms—lenders pay us for connecting them with qualified borrowers.\n\n100+ Lenders\nNo Credit Impact\n3-Minute Process\n$1K-$100K Loans\nAll Credit Levels\nCompetitive Rates\nSame-Day Funding\nNo Obligation\nReady to Compare Your Options?\nGet Started - Compare Rates Now →\nPowered by\n\nOr call us: (661) 310-3040\n\nHave a question about credit, funding, or your next financial move?

You may not get the absolute lowest rate, but you'll see your best options—and refinancing can still save you money even with less-than-perfect credit.\n\nWhat If You Could Lower Your Rate in Minutes and Keep $2,000+ Over the Life of Your Loan?\n\nWe connect you with lenders competing for your business—often dropping your rate 2-4%. Check your rate without impacting your credit score. Get approved in 24-48 hours. We advocate for you, negotiating terms dealerships never offered.\n\nCompare Your Options →\nPowered by\nAuto Loan Refinancing Requirements\nWhat You'll Need to Apply\n✓\nVehicle Information: Year, make, model, mileage, VIN\n✓\nCurrent Loan Details: Remaining balance, current lender name, monthly payment\n✓\nPersonal Info: Name, address, SSN, date of birth\n✓\nIncome Verification: Pay stubs, tax returns, or bank statements\n✓\nProof of Insurance: Current auto insurance card\n\nDon't worry—most of this you can fill in from memory. Documents only needed if you accept a loan.\n\nTypical Lender Requirements\n•\nVehicle Age: Typically less than 10 years old (some lenders go up to 15 years)\n•\nLoan Balance: Usually $7,500 - $100,000 remaining\n•\nVehicle Value: Must not be \"upside-down\" (owe more than car's worth)\n•\nCredit Score: Minimum 500-580 for most lenders\n•\nTime Since Purchase: Wait at least 60-90 days from original loan\n\nRequirements vary by lender. Our platform shows you which lenders you qualify for.\n\nImportant: What If I'm \"Upside-Down\" on My Loan?\n\nBeing \"upside-down\" means you owe more on your loan than your car is currently worth. For example, if you owe $18,000 but your car is only worth $15,000, you're upside-down by $3,000.\n\nCan you still refinance? It depends. Some lenders will refinance upside-down loans, but you may:\n\n•\nNeed to pay the difference before refinancing\n•\nGet a higher interest rate\n•\nRoll the negative equity into the new loan (not ideal)\n\nHow to check: Look up your car's value on Kelley Blue Book (kbb.com), then compare it to your loan payoff amount (call your current lender).\n\nPicture an Extra $150 in Your Pocket Each Month. Imagine Owning Your Car Outright Sooner.\n\nImagine redirecting those savings toward a vacation fund, emergency cushion, or paying off your car a year early. Watching your balance drop faster while your credit score climbs. That financial flexibility you deserve is one decision away.\n\nStart Saving Today →\nPowered by\nCommon Questions About Auto Loan Refinancing\n\nGet answers to common questions about refinancing your auto loan.\n\nWill refinancing my car loan hurt my credit score?\n\nChecking your rates through our platform uses a soft credit check, which does NOT hurt your credit score. You can compare offers from 100+ lenders with zero credit impact. When you formally accept a loan and the lender does final verification, there will be a hard credit inquiry, which may temporarily lower your score by a few points. However, if you make all your refinanced loan payments on time, your credit score will improve over time.\n\nHow much can I actually save by refinancing my car loan?\n\nIt depends on your current rate, new rate, and loan balance. On average, borrowers save $50-$150/month and $1,200-$3,600 over the life of the loan. Even a 1-2% rate drop can save thousands. For example, refinancing a $20,000 loan from 7.5% to 4.5% APR saves you about $26/month and $1,248 in total interest over 48 months. Your actual savings depend on your situation.\n\nHow soon after buying my car can I refinance?\n\nYou should wait at least 60-90 days after your original loan before refinancing. This gives time for the vehicle title to transfer properly, which is required before any lender will approve a refinance. Some borrowers with excellent credit can refinance earlier, but 60-90 days is the safe minimum for most people.\n\nCan I refinance if I bought my car from a dealer?\n\nYes! It doesn't matter where you bought your car—dealership, private party, or even if you financed through the dealer. You can refinance with any lender on our platform. In fact, many dealers mark up interest rates, so refinancing away from dealer financing often gets you a better deal.\n\nWhat if my car is really old or has high mileage?\n\nMost lenders require cars to be less than 10 years old, though some go up to 15 years. High mileage can affect eligibility and rates—lenders typically prefer vehicles under 100,000-125,000 miles, but some will work with higher mileage. The older or higher-mileage your car, the fewer lenders you'll qualify for, but it's still worth checking your options.\n\nCan I refinance to remove a co-signer from my loan?\n\nYes! This is one of the most common reasons people refinance. If you needed a co-signer originally but your credit has improved, you can refinance into a new loan in your name only, removing the co-signer from responsibility. This gives both you and your co-signer financial independence.\n\nWill my monthly payment definitely go down?\n\nNot necessarily—it depends on your goals. If you want a lower monthly payment, you can refinance to a lower rate or extend your loan term. If you want to pay off your car faster, you can refinance to a shorter term, which increases your monthly payment but saves you interest. The choice is yours based on your financial goals.\n\nAre there any fees for refinancing my car loan?\n\nOur comparison platform is 100% free to use. However, some lenders may charge: (1) loan origination fees (typically 1-2% of loan amount), (2) title transfer fees (usually $50-$150, depending on your state), (3) lien filing fees (varies by state). These fees are clearly disclosed before you accept any loan offer. Many lenders have $0 origination fees.\n\nWhat happens to my old auto loan when I refinance?\n\nYour new lender pays off your old loan in full and closes that account. You'll start making payments to your new lender under the new terms. The process is seamless—you don't need to coordinate anything between lenders. Your new lender handles all the paperwork and title transfer.\n\nCan I refinance a leased vehicle?\n\nTechnically, no—you can't refinance a lease because you don't own the car. However, you can do a 'lease buyout' where you purchase the leased vehicle and finance it with a loan. Some of our lending partners offer lease buyout financing. If you're interested in keeping your leased car, this is an option worth exploring.\n\nReal Drivers, Real Savings\n\nSee how others lowered their car payments by refinancing through our platform.\n\n\"Refinanced my 2021 Honda Accord from 8.2% to 4.8% APR.

This can significantly reduce your monthly payments and the total amount you'll pay over the life of the loan.\n\nHow It Works\n1️⃣\nNew Lender Pays Off Old Loans\n\nA new lender pays off all your existing student loans in full\n\n2️⃣\nYou Get One New Loan\n\nYou receive a single new loan with better terms and lower rate\n\n3️⃣\nStart Saving Money\n\nLower interest means more money in your pocket every month\n\nCheck My Rates (Won't Affect Credit)\nWhy Thousands of Graduates Are Refinancing\n\nRefinancing your student loans can unlock financial freedom and help you achieve your goals faster\n\n📉\nLower Interest Rates\n\nSecure a competitive rate based on your current credit score and income—often significantly lower than your original student loan rates. Even a 1% reduction can save you thousands.\n\n💰\nReduced Monthly Payments\n\nFree up cash flow each month by extending your repayment term or lowering your interest rate. Use the extra money for savings, investing, or other financial goals.\n\n🎯\nSimplified Repayment\n\nCombine multiple student loans into one convenient monthly payment. No more juggling different due dates, servicers, or payment amounts.\n\n⏰\nFlexible Term Options\n\nChoose a repayment term that fits your budget—from 5 to 20 years. Shorter terms mean less interest paid overall; longer terms provide lower monthly payments.\n\n👥\nRemove a Cosigner\n\nIf you had a cosigner on your original loans, refinancing in your name alone can release them from that obligation and give you full financial independence.\n\n🚀\nPay Off Debt Faster\n\nLower rates mean more of your payment goes toward principal. You can become debt-free years earlier without increasing your monthly payment.\n\nStart Saving Today →\nGet Started in 3 Simple Steps\n\nFrom rate comparison to debt freedom—we make refinancing easy\n\n1\nCompare Your Options\n\nAnswer a few quick questions about your loans, credit score, and income.

A score of 650 or higher typically unlocks competitive offers. The higher your score, the better your rate.\n\n✓\nSteady Income\n\nLenders want to see reliable income that demonstrates your ability to repay. Full-time employment or consistent self-employment income qualifies.\n\n✓\nHigh-Interest Private Loans\n\nIf your current loans have rates above 6-7%, refinancing can lead to substantial savings. Private student loans are especially good candidates for refinancing.\n\n⚠️\nFederal Loans You're Willing to Convert\n\nFederal loans come with unique protections (income-driven repayment, forgiveness programs). If you don't need these benefits, refinancing can save you money. Consider carefully before refinancing federal loans.\n\n✓\nNo Plans for Loan Forgiveness\n\nIf you're pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) or other federal programs, keep federal loans separate and don't refinance them. Refinancing makes you ineligible for forgiveness.\n\nSee If You Qualify\n\nCheck your rate in 2 minutes with zero impact to your credit score\n\nCheck My Qualification →\nReal Savings Examples\n\nSee how much borrowers like you are saving through refinancing\n\n🎓\nRecent Graduate\nOriginal Loan:\n$50,000\nOriginal Rate:\n6.8%\nNew Rate:\n4.5%\nTerm:\n10 years\nMonthly Savings\n$142\nTotal Savings\n$17,040\n💼\nEstablished Professional\nOriginal Loan:\n$100,000\nOriginal Rate:\n7.5%\nNew Rate:\n5.0%\nTerm:\n15 years\nMonthly Savings\n$267\nTotal Savings\n$48,060\n🚀\nPrivate Loan Holder\nOriginal Loan:\n$75,000\nOriginal Rate:\n9.0%\nNew Rate:\n5.5%\nTerm:\n15 years\nMonthly Savings\n$267\nTotal Savings\n$48,060\nCalculate My Savings →\nCommon Questions About Student Loan Refinancing\n\nGet answers to your most pressing questions about refinancing.\n\nWill checking rates affect my credit score?\n\nNo. Our rate comparison uses a soft credit check, which doesn't impact your score. Only when you formally apply with a lender will a hard inquiry be performed.\n\nHow long does refinancing take?\n\nMost borrowers complete the process in 2-4 weeks. Rate comparison takes 2 minutes, and applications typically take 15-30 minutes to complete.\n\nCan I refinance federal and private loans together?\n\nYes. Many lenders allow you to consolidate both federal and private loans into a single new loan. Remember, federal loans will lose their protections if refinanced.\n\nWhat credit score do I need?\n\nMost lenders require a minimum score of 650, though the best rates go to borrowers with scores above 700. Some lenders offer options for borrowers with lower scores.\n\nCan I refinance multiple times?\n\nAbsolutely. Many borrowers refinance again when rates drop or their credit improves. There's no limit to how many times you can refinance.\n\nAre there fees to refinance?\n\nMost lenders don't charge application, origination, or prepayment fees. However, always read the terms carefully before accepting an offer.\n\nNo Credit Impact\nCompare 10+ Lenders\n2-Minute Process\nSave Up to $288/Month\nNo Obligation\nSSL Secure\nBakersfield Office\nYour Info Is Safe\nReady to Lower Your Student Loan Payments?\n\nCompare personalized rates from top lenders in 2 minutes.

Here's how to know if it makes sense for you.\n\nYou're a Good Candidate If:\nYour credit score has improved since taking out your loans (typically 650+ required)\nYou have stable employment and steady income\nYour current interest rate is 6% or higher\nYou have private student loans or can afford to lose federal loan benefits\nYou want to simplify multiple loan payments\nYou're comfortable with a private lender\nYou Might Want to Wait If:\nYou're relying on income-driven repayment plans\nYou're pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)\nYou need federal forbearance or deferment options\nYour income is unstable or you may face unemployment\nYou have poor credit (under 650) and no co-signer\nYou're currently in school or grace period\n\nImportant Note:\n\nIf you have federal student loans, carefully weigh the benefits of a lower rate against the loss of federal protections before refinancing. Once you refinance federal loans with a private lender, you cannot get those federal benefits back.\n\nWhat If Refinancing Could Save You $288/Month and Cut Years Off Your Repayment?\n\nThrough our SuperMoney partnership, compare 10+ lenders in minutes—no credit score impact. Lower your rate 1-3%, reduce monthly payments, or pay off faster. We see your potential for financial freedom where lenders see only numbers.

Your financial freedom is one decision away.\n\nStart Your Debt-Free Journey →\nPowered by\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nGet answers to common questions about student loan refinancing.\n\nWill checking my rate hurt my credit score?\nNo! Checking your rate only requires a soft credit pull, which doesn't affect your credit score. Only when you formally apply with a lender will a hard credit inquiry be performed.\nHow much can I save by refinancing my student loans?\nSavings vary based on your current rate, new rate, and loan balance. On average, borrowers save $20,000+ over the life of their loan. Some save even more if they have high-interest private loans or significant debt.\nCan I refinance both federal and private student loans?\nYes, you can refinance both federal and private loans into one new private loan. However, refinancing federal loans means losing federal benefits like income-driven repayment, PSLF, and forbearance options.\nWhat credit score do I need to refinance?\nMost lenders require a minimum credit score of 650-660, though some may work with scores as low as 640. The higher your credit score, the better rate you'll qualify for.\nHow long does the refinancing process take?\nChecking rates takes just 2-3 minutes. Once you choose a lender and apply, the process typically takes 2-4 weeks from application to disbursement.\nWhat is the minimum loan amount I can refinance?\nMost lenders require a minimum balance of $5,000 to refinance. There's typically a maximum of $300,000-$500,000 depending on the lender.\nDo I need to be employed to refinance?\nYes, most lenders require steady employment and verifiable income. Some lenders may consider other income sources like spousal income or investments.\nCan I refinance while I'm still in school?\nNo, you typically need to have graduated and completed your grace period before refinancing. Lenders want to see you've established employment and steady income.\nWill I lose my grace period if I refinance?\nYes, refinancing converts your loans into a new private loan with immediate repayment. However, some lenders offer a brief forbearance period after refinancing.\nWhat happens to my original loans when I refinance?\nYour new lender pays off your existing loans directly. Your original loans are closed, and you'll only have the new refinanced loan to repay.\nGet Your Personalized Rates\nPowered by\nImportant Considerations\n\nUnderstand what you're giving up when refinancing federal student loans\n\nFederal Benefits You'll Lose When Refinancing:\nIncome-Driven Repayment Plans - Payments based on your income and family size\nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) - Forgiveness after 10 years of public service employment\nForbearance & Deferment - Temporarily pause payments during hardship\nLoan Forgiveness Programs - Teacher forgiveness, disability discharge, death discharge\nFederal Consolidation - Ability to consolidate federal loans in the future\nFlexible Payment Options - Graduated, extended, and alternative repayment plans\n\n⚠️ This is a one-way decision. Once you refinance federal loans, you cannot convert them back.\n\nWhen Refinancing Makes Sense:\nYour savings significantly outweigh the value of federal protections\nYou have stable employment in the private sector\nYou don't anticipate needing income-driven repayment\nYou're not pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness\nYou have an emergency fund to cover 6+ months of expenses\nYour career path is stable with low unemployment risk\nI Understand - Check My Rates\nPowered by\nNo Credit Impact\nCompare 10+ Lenders\n2-Minute Process\nSave Up to $288/Month\nNo Obligation\n100% Free Comparison\nSecure & Private\nSoft Credit Check Only\nReady to Start Saving?\n\nCompare 10+ lenders in 2 minutes—with zero impact to your credit score.\n\nCheck My New Rate →\nPowered by\n\nOr call us: (661) 310-3040\n\nHave a question about credit, funding, or your next financial move?

That financial freedom you deserve is one decision away.\n\nStart Your Debt-Free Journey →\nPowered by\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nGet answers to common questions about debt consolidation loans.\n\nWhat is debt consolidation?\n\nDebt consolidation is the process of combining multiple debts—like credit cards, medical bills, and personal loans—into a single loan with one monthly payment. The goal is to simplify your finances, lower your interest rate, and pay off debt faster.\n\nWill checking rates affect my credit score?\n\nNo! When you check rates through our platform, we only use a soft credit inquiry, which does not impact your credit score. Only when you formally apply with a specific lender will they perform a hard credit pull—and only after you've chosen to proceed.\n\nHow much can I save with debt consolidation?\n\nSavings vary based on your current debts and the rate you qualify for. On average, clients who consolidate credit card debt (typically 20-25% APR) into a personal loan (8-15% APR) save $200-$400 per month. Over the life of the loan, this can add up to thousands of dollars in interest savings.\n\nWhat types of debt can I consolidate?\n\nYou can consolidate most unsecured debts including credit cards, medical bills, personal loans, payday loans, collection accounts, and other installment debts. Secured debts like mortgages and auto loans typically require different solutions.\n\nWhat credit score do I need to qualify?\n\nWhile many lenders prefer credit scores of 640+, our network includes lenders who work with scores as low as 580 or even lower. Your credit score affects your interest rate more than your approval odds—better credit typically means lower rates.\n\nHow fast can I get funded?\n\nOnce approved by a lender, funds are typically deposited into your bank account within 1-3 business days. The lender then pays off your existing debts directly. The overall timeline from application to debt payoff is usually 3-7 business days.\n\nIs debt consolidation the same as debt settlement?\n\nNo, they are very different. Debt consolidation is a loan that pays off your existing debts in full—you then repay the new loan over time. Debt settlement involves negotiating with creditors to pay less than you owe, which can significantly damage your credit. Consolidation is generally a better option if you can qualify for a loan.\n\nWill I save money if I consolidate?\n\nYou'll likely save money if: 1) Your new interest rate is lower than the average of your current rates, 2) You pay off the loan within the term (don't extend your debt timeline significantly), and 3) You don't accumulate new debt on the accounts you paid off. Our comparison tool shows you exactly how much you'll save before you commit.\n\nWhat happens to my credit cards after I consolidate?\n\nAfter consolidation, your credit cards will be paid off and have zero balances. You can keep the accounts open (which can help your credit utilization ratio) or close them. Many financial advisors recommend keeping older accounts open but removing temptation by cutting up the physical cards.\n\nAre there any fees I should know about?\n\nSome lenders charge an origination fee (typically 1-6% of the loan amount), which is deducted from your loan proceeds. Other potential fees include late payment fees. Many lenders do not charge prepayment penalties, allowing you to pay off your loan early without penalty. Always review the loan terms before accepting.\n\nIs Mesa Group Consulting a lender?\n\nNo, Mesa Group Consulting is not a lender. We are a financial services marketplace that connects consumers with multiple lending partners. We do not make lending decisions or fund loans—we help you compare offers from our network of trusted lenders to find the best solution for your situation.\n\nHow is this different from a balance transfer credit card?\n\nBalance transfer cards offer low intro APRs (often 0%) but typically for only 12-21 months, after which rates jump to 20%+. If you can't pay off the balance in that time, you're back to high interest. Debt consolidation loans have fixed rates for the entire term (3-7 years), making them better for larger amounts or longer payoff timelines.\n\n30+ Lenders\nNo Credit Impact\n3-Minute Process\n$5K-$100K Loans\nLower Interest Rates\nOne Simple Payment\nFast Funding\nNo Obligation\nReady to Simplify Your Debt?\nCompare Consolidation Offers Now →\nPowered by\n\nOr call us: (661) 310-3040\n\nHave a question about credit, funding, or your next financial move?

Taking your family on that vacation you've been postponing for years. Watching your debt balance drop to zero in 2-4 years—not 20. That financial freedom you deserve is one decision away.\n\nStart Your Debt-Free Journey\nPowered by\nDebt Relief Questions Answered\n\nGet clarity before booking your free consultation.\n\nHow does Mesa Group Consulting's Debt Relief program work?\n\nOur program works by negotiating with your creditors to settle debts for 30-50% less than you owe. You stop paying creditors directly and instead make one affordable monthly deposit into a dedicated savings account under your control. As funds accumulate, our expert negotiators work with your creditors to secure settlement offers. When settlements are reached, creditors are paid directly from your account. The entire process typically takes 20-48 months to complete.\n\nIs debt relief better than making minimum payments?\n\nAbsolutely. If you only make minimum payments on a $20,000 credit card balance at 18% APR, you'll pay over $50,000 total and take 30+ years to pay it off. With debt relief, you could settle that same debt for $10,000-$14,000 (including fees) and be debt-free in 2-4 years. You save tens of thousands of dollars and decades of stress.\n\nHow much will I save with Mesa Group Consulting's program?\n\nOn average, clients save 30-50% on enrolled debts (approximately 43% average) before program fees. For example, if you have $30,000 in credit card debt, you might settle for $15,000-$21,000 total, including program fees. Actual savings depend on your creditors, debt types, and negotiation outcomes. During your free consultation, we'll provide a personalized savings estimate.\n\nDo I qualify for debt relief?\n\nYou may qualify if: (1) You have at least $10,000 in unsecured debt, (2) You're experiencing financial hardship or struggling with payments, (3) Your debts are with creditors who negotiate with debt relief companies, and (4) Your debts are unsecured (not backed by collateral). Federal student loans, secured debts like mortgages or car loans, child support, and most tax debts typically don't qualify. Book a free consultation to determine your eligibility.\n\nWhat does Mesa Group Consulting's program cost?\n\nWe charge NO UPFRONT FEES. Our fees are performance-based and range from 14-25% of your enrolled debt amount, charged only as debts are successfully settled. For example, on $30,000 enrolled debt with a 20% fee structure, our total fees would be $6,000, paid gradually as each debt settles. You pay nothing until we deliver results. This is required by FTC regulations.\n\nWhat's the difference between debt relief and debt consolidation?\n\nDebt consolidation combines multiple debts into one loan—you still owe 100% of the principal plus interest, and you need good credit to qualify. Debt relief (settlement) negotiates with creditors to reduce the total amount you owe by 30-50%. You don't need good credit to qualify for debt relief, and you end up paying significantly less than you originally owed.\n\nHow long will it take to be debt-free?\n\nMost debt relief programs take 20-48 months to complete, depending on your total debt amount, monthly deposit capacity, and creditor cooperation. Your first settlement typically occurs within 4-7 months of enrollment, with additional settlements approximately every 3-6 months thereafter. We'll provide a realistic timeline during your consultation based on your specific situation.\n\nWill debt relief impact my credit score?\n\nYes, debt relief will likely have a negative impact on your credit score temporarily because you'll stop making payments to creditors during negotiations. However, if your credit is already damaged from late payments or collections, the impact may be minimal. The alternative—bankruptcy—is far more damaging and lasts 7-10 years. Debt relief allows you to rebuild credit faster after completion, and most clients see their scores recover within 2-3 years.\n\nCan you help if I'm already facing lawsuits or judgments?\n\nYes! We can often negotiate settlements even after lawsuits are filed or judgments are entered. Early intervention is best, but we work with collection attorneys and creditors at all stages of the collection process. In some cases, we can negotiate to stop wage garnishments or bank levies as part of settlement agreements.\n\nWhat happens if I can't complete the program?\n\nYou can withdraw from the program at any time without penalty.

Our estate planning documents are built by licensed attorneys and customized to meet your specific state's legal requirements. Once you sign them according to your state's witness and notarization requirements (which we provide clear instructions for), they are 100% legally binding and enforceable in court. Thousands of families use online estate planning documents successfully every year.\n\nWhat's the difference between a Will and a Trust?\n\nA Will takes effect after you die and goes through probate court (a public, 6-12 month process). A Trust takes effect immediately, holds your assets during your lifetime, and transfers them privately after death—avoiding probate entirely. Both name guardians for children and specify your wishes. Choose a Will if you have a modest estate and don't mind probate. Choose a Trust if you own a home, want privacy, or have significant assets ($100K+).\n\nDo I need an attorney to create a Will or Trust?\n\nNo. Our platform is built BY attorneys but designed FOR everyday people to use without legal help. The documents are attorney-crafted, state-specific templates that you customize by answering simple questions. It's the same quality as hiring an attorney, but you save $2,000-$5,000 and avoid multiple appointments. However, if your estate is extremely complex (business ownership, international assets, special needs trusts), you may want to consult with an attorney.\n\nWhat happens if I don't have a Will or Trust?\n\nIf you die without a Will or Trust, you die 'intestate' and state law decides what happens to your assets and who raises your children. This process (called intestate succession) may not match your wishes at all. For example, if you're unmarried with kids, your assets might go to your parents instead of your children. Courts will appoint guardians for your kids—possibly someone you wouldn't choose. Plus, your estate goes through probate, which costs 3-7% of your estate value and takes 6-24 months.\n\nCan I update my Will or Trust after I create it?\n\nYes! Life changes (marriage, divorce, new children, moving states), and your estate plan should change with it. With a Will plan, you can log back in anytime and create an updated version for a small fee. With a Trust plan, your first year of membership is FREE ($39/year after), which includes unlimited updates. You can add assets, change beneficiaries, update guardians, or make any other changes whenever needed.\n\nHow do I know which plan to choose—Will or Trust?\n\nChoose a Will if: you're young (under 40), have minimal assets (under $100K), don't own a home, and are okay with the probate process. Choose a Trust if: you own a home, have assets over $100K, want to avoid probate, value privacy, want faster asset transfer, or have a complex family situation (blended family, children from multiple relationships). Most homeowners choose the Trust plan. Still not sure? The questionnaire will help guide you.\n\nWhat if I live in multiple states or plan to move?\n\nYour estate planning documents are state-specific and based on where you currently live. If you move to a new state, you should update your documents to comply with that state's laws. With membership (included free first year with Trust plan), you can easily update your documents for your new state. Some states have significantly different requirements, so updating is important.\n\nDo I need witnesses or a notary?\n\nIt depends on your state. Most states require 2-3 witnesses for Wills (who are NOT beneficiaries), and some also require notarization. Trusts typically require notarization but not witnesses. We provide clear, state-specific instructions on exactly what your state requires. You can find notaries at banks, UPS stores, or use online notarization services (available in most states).\n\nCan my spouse and I create one joint Will or Trust?\n\nWe recommend each spouse have their own separate Will or Trust (called 'mirror' documents). This is the standard legal practice and avoids complications. Our couples pricing bundles two individual plans together at a discount ($299 for Will couples plan, $599 for Trust couples plan). Each spouse's documents work together but remain legally separate.\n\nWhat if I have minor children? How do I name guardians?\n\nBoth the Will and Trust plans allow you to nominate guardians for your minor children (and pets!). You can name a primary guardian and backup guardians. If something happens to both parents, the court will appoint your chosen guardian to raise your children. Without a Will or Trust, the court decides who raises your kids—which may not be who you'd want. Naming guardians is one of the most important reasons parents create estate plans.\n\nWho Needs Estate Planning?\n\nYou don't need to be wealthy or elderly to need an estate plan. If any of these apply to you, you need a Will or Trust today.\n\nParents with Minor Children\n\nCritical need: Without a Will, courts decide who raises your children if something happens to you.\n\n•\nName guardians for kids (and pets)\n•\nSet up trusts for minor children\n•\nProtect inheritance until they're adults\nRecommended: Will Plan minimum, Trust Plan ideal\nHomeowners\n\nSave your family thousands: Probate costs 3-7% of estate value. On a $500K home, that's $15K-$35K in legal fees.\n\n•\nAvoid probate with a Trust\n•\nTransfer property immediately\n•\nKeep real estate affairs private\nRecommended: Trust Plan (avoids probate)\nBlended Families\n\nPrevent family conflict: State law may give assets to people you don't intend. Clearly document your wishes.\n\n•\nProtect children from previous marriage\n•\nBalance current spouse & kids' needs\n•\nAdd conditions to distributions\nRecommended: Trust Plan (more control)\nUnmarried Couples\n\nNo automatic rights: Without marriage, your partner gets NOTHING by default. State law gives everything to blood relatives.\n\n•\nLeave assets to your partner\n•\nGrant medical decision-making rights\n•\nPrevent family from contesting wishes\nRecommended: Will Plan minimum, Trust Plan ideal\nBusiness Owners\n\nProtect your business: Without planning, your business could be frozen or sold during probate, destroying value.\n\n•\nPlan business succession\n•\nAvoid probate disruption\n•\nTransfer ownership smoothly\nRecommended: Trust Plan + business attorney\nAnyone Over 40\n\nLife is unpredictable: Accidents, illness, and incapacity can happen at any age. Protect yourself and your family.\n\n•\nDocument healthcare wishes\n•\nAssign Power of Attorney\n•\nGive family clear guidance\nRecommended: Will Plan at minimum\nHigh Net Worth Individuals\n\nSignificant assets ($500K+): Probate is expensive, public, and slow. Trusts protect wealth and privacy.\n\n•\nMinimize estate taxes\n•\nKeep financial details private\n•\nControl how/when heirs receive assets\nRecommended: Trust Plan essential\nPet Parents\n\nProtect your pets: Without planning, your pets could end up in shelters. Name caregivers and set aside funds.\n\n•\nName pet guardians\n•\nAllocate money for pet care\n•\nDocument care instructions\nRecommended: Will Plan at minimum\nDigital Asset Owners\n\nModern wealth: Cryptocurrency, online businesses, digital art, and social media accounts need planning too.\n\n•\nDocument cryptocurrency access\n•\nAssign digital executor\n•\nPlan for online business transfer\nRecommended: Trust Plan\nThe Truth: Everyone Needs Estate Planning\n\nIf you have anyone you care about, anything you own, or any wishes for your care, you need an estate plan.\n\nIt's not about age or wealth—it's about protecting the people and things you love. The average cost of creating an estate plan online is $199-$599. The average cost of NOT having one is $15,000-$50,000+ in probate fees, plus months of stress for your family.\n\nWhich would you rather invest in?\n\nReal Families, Real Peace of Mind\n\nSee how families across America are protecting their loved ones with Trust & Will.\n\n\"As a new mom, I kept putting off creating a Will because I thought it would be complicated and expensive. This platform made it SO easy. In 20 minutes, I named guardians for my daughter and designated where everything goes.

For $599, we got everything we needed—state-specific, legally binding, and done from our couch in under an hour.\"\n\nDavid & Jennifer K.\n\nTrust Estate Plan • Homeowners\n\n\"My dad passed away without a Will and the probate process was a nightmare—9 months, tons of legal fees, and family fighting.

Your family's security is one decision away.\n\nSecure Your Family's Future →\nPowered by\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nGet answers to common questions about life insurance and our service.\n\nHow much life insurance do I need?\n\nA common rule of thumb is 10-12 times your annual income. However, the right amount depends on your specific situation including debts, income, dependents, and long-term financial goals. PolicyGenius agents can help you calculate the optimal coverage amount for your family's needs.\n\nHow much does life insurance cost?\n\nTerm life insurance is surprisingly affordable—many healthy individuals in their 30s can get $500,000 in coverage for $20-30 per month. Costs vary based on age, health, lifestyle habits (smoking), coverage amount, and policy type. Get a free personalized quote to see exact pricing for your situation.\n\nDo I need a medical exam?\n\nMost traditional policies require a medical exam, which is typically free and completed at your home or workplace. The exam includes basic measurements (height, weight, blood pressure) and blood/urine samples. Some policies offer no-exam options, though they may have higher premiums or lower coverage limits.\n\nWhat's the difference between term and whole life insurance?\n\nTerm life insurance provides coverage for a specific period (10, 20, or 30 years) and is typically more affordable. Whole life insurance provides permanent coverage for your entire life and builds cash value, but costs significantly more. Term is best for temporary needs; whole life is better for estate planning and long-term wealth building.\n\nCan I get life insurance if I have health conditions?\n\nYes. Many people with health conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or even cancer history can still qualify for coverage. Insurers will consider your specific condition, how well it's managed, and overall health. Some conditions may result in higher premiums, but coverage is often still available.\n\nHow long does the application process take?\n\nThe entire process typically takes 2-6 weeks from application to approval. You can complete the online application in 10-15 minutes, schedule your medical exam within days, and most approvals come within 24-48 hours after the exam. Some policies offer instant decisions for qualifying applicants.\n\nIs the death benefit taxable?\n\nNo. Life insurance death benefits are generally income-tax-free to your beneficiaries. This is one of the key advantages of life insurance—your loved ones receive the full benefit amount without tax implications. However, the cash value growth in permanent policies may have tax considerations; consult a tax advisor for specifics.\n\nCan I change my coverage amount later?\n\nIt depends on your policy type. Term life insurance typically has fixed coverage for the term length, though some policies offer conversion options to permanent coverage. Whole and universal life policies often allow adjustments to death benefits and premiums (subject to underwriting). It's generally easier to decrease coverage than increase it.\n\nWhat if I miss a premium payment?\n\nMost policies have a grace period (typically 30-31 days) after your payment due date. If you pay within the grace period, your coverage continues uninterrupted. If you miss the grace period, your policy may lapse. Contact your insurer immediately if you're having payment difficulties—they may offer options.\n\nDo I need life insurance if I'm young and single?\n\nEven if you don't have dependents, life insurance can make sense if you have: (1) cosigned student loans or other debts that family would inherit, (2) want to lock in lower rates while you're young and healthy, (3) plan to have a family soon, or (4) want to help cover final expenses. It's also significantly cheaper when you're younger.\n\nHow does PolicyGenius make money if quotes are free?\n\nPolicyGenius is compensated by insurance carriers when you purchase a policy—similar to how traditional insurance agents are paid. This commission is built into the policy price by the carrier, so you pay the same whether you buy through PolicyGenius or directly from the insurer. There are no extra fees or markups.\n\nIs PolicyGenius trustworthy?\n\nYes. PolicyGenius is a licensed insurance broker with licenses in all 50 states. They've helped over 30 million people shop for insurance and are rated A+ by the Better Business Bureau. PolicyGenius works with top-rated carriers (A.M. Best ratings of A or higher) and their agents are licensed professionals bound by strict regulations.\n\nStill Have Questions?\n\nConnect with a licensed PolicyGenius agent who can answer your specific questions and help you find the right coverage.\n\nSpeak with an Expert\nPowered by\nLicensed Agents\n5-Minute Quotes\nA+ Rated Insurers\nNo Obligation\nCompare Top Carriers\nExpert Guidance\n100% Secure\nFree Quotes\nReady to Protect Your Family's Future?\n\nGet your free, personalized life insurance quote in minutes.

We hired two employees, bought a second truck, and doubled revenue in six months. The team was transparent about timelines and delivered exactly what they promised.\"\n\n— Sarah M., Construction Company Owner | Funded: $250,000\n\n\"Funded in 18 days after months of rejections\"\n\n\"The difference was night and day. Other brokers sent a generic application. Mesa Group Capital told our story and positioned us strategically across their lender network. They knew exactly which lenders would appreciate our tech business model.\"\n\n— James K., Tech Startup Founder | Funded: $85,000\n\n\"Got $75K even with damaged credit from my divorce\"\n\n\"I thought my credit was too damaged after my divorce. They helped me understand what their lenders actually care about and which programs I qualified for. Got $75K for inventory through their factoring partner. Now we're on track for our best year ever.\"\n\n— Patricia L., E-commerce Retailer | Funded: $75,000\n\n\"$187K at 0% changed everything for my e-commerce business\"\n\n\"I was stuck at $50K in revenue because I couldn't afford inventory at scale. Mesa helped me secure $187K at 0%. I 5x'd my inventory and hit $340K in revenue within 6 months. The 0% interest saved me $25K that hired two employees.\"\n\n— Sarah M., E-commerce Owner | 0% Funding: $187,000\n\n\"Built business credit from zero to $75K in funding\"\n\n\"Every bank told me no because my business was 'too new.' Mesa Group built our business credit from scratch and within 10 months, we had $75K in funding and landed our first municipal contract without ever risking my personal assets.\"\n\n— Jennifer R., General Contractor | Business Credit Program\n\n\"Freedom from $180K in merchant cash advances\"\n\n\"We owed $180K in merchant cash advances that were bleeding us dry with weekly payments. Mesa Group negotiated settlements for $68K total and restructured the rest. We're finally profitable again and actually growing.\"\n\n— David L., Restaurant Owner | Debt Relief\n\nCommon Questions About Our Business Services\nHow do I know which service I need?\nDo I need to have good personal credit to work with you?\nHow long does it take to see results?\nWhat if I'm turned down for funding?\nCan I use multiple services at once?\nDo you work with startups or only established businesses?\nWhat industries do you work with?\nIs this just for corporations, or can LLCs and sole proprietors qualify too?\nHow much does it cost to work with Mesa Group?\nWhat's the catch?\nStill Have Questions?

Same Destination.\nPath 1: Build It Yourself\n\nYou can try to figure out business credit on your own. Research which vendors report. Navigate credit bureau requirements. Hope you're applying in the right order. Pray you don't damage your credit in the process.\n\nMost business owners who go this route spend 18-24 months (if they succeed at all) and make costly mistakes along the way.\n\nPath 2: Let Us Engineer Your Approval\n\nWe've built business credit for 720+ business owners. We know exactly which steps to take, in what order, and how to position you for maximum approval rates. Our system is proven. Our timeline is 6-12 months. Our guarantee is $50K minimum.\n\nThe question isn't \"can I build business credit?\"\nThe question is: \"How much is it costing me to wait?\"\n\nEvery month without business credit is another month of:\n\nRisking personal assets on business decisions\nLimited access to capital when opportunities arise\nHigher interest rates and worse terms\nSlower business growth tied to personal limits\nCommon Questions About Building Business Credit\nWhat is a Business Credit Bureau?\n\nA business credit bureau is an agency that collects and researches data on businesses and sells it for a fee to lenders and credit issuers to make lending decisions. It may also be called a commercial business credit reporting agency, or a corporate credit bureau. The three major business credit bureaus are Dun & Bradstreet, Experian Business, and Equifax Business.\n\nWhat is a Business Credit History?\n\nA business credit history is the number of trade payment experiences reported on business credit reports. This includes payment terms, amounts, and whether payments were made on time. Your business credit history shows lenders how your business handles credit obligations over time.\n\nWhat Does it Mean to Establish Business Tradelines?\n\nEstablishing business tradelines is the act of applying to and using accounts that report to the business credit bureaus. A tradeline is any credit account—vendor accounts, business credit cards, lines of credit—that appears on your business credit report and shows your payment history.\n\nWhat is a Personal Guarantee?\n\nA personal guarantee is an individual's legal promise to repay credit issued to a business where they are an owner, executive, or a partner. With business credit agreements, giving a personal guarantee essentially makes you a co-signer on the business credit account. You remain personally liable for any debts the business incurs. In practice, this means your personal credit undergoes a hard inquiry, your personal credit score can be affected, and your personal assets are at risk if the business defaults. With strong business credit, you can eventually access funding WITHOUT personal guarantees.\n\nWhat is Trade Credit?\n\nTrade credit is credit issued by vendors to businesses for the purchase of goods or services. Instead of paying upfront, the vendor extends credit terms (like Net 30), allowing you to receive the product or service now and pay within the agreed timeframe.\n\nWhat Are Business Credit Tiers?\n\nBusiness credit tiers are our terminology for categorizing credit sources by difficulty level and requirements. For example: Tier 1: Vendor Credit (easy to get started, minimal requirements), Tier 2: Retail Business Credit (requires some business credit history), Tier 3: Bank Business Credit Cards (requires stronger business credit profile), Tier 4: Business Lines of Credit & Term Loans (requires established business credit profile with strong scores).\n\nHow Does Business Credit Work When Seeking Loans?\n\nWhen a lending institution has more than just your personal credit scores to look at, they will review any other information they believe will better answer their one big question: Will you pay them back? Lending institutions review your business credit reports looking for: Do you pay your bills on time? Are there negative items on your credit reports? How long have you been in business? Is the business credible? If the answers to these questions satisfy the lending institution, then you're more likely to get a loan.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Build Business Credit?\n\nMost businesses can build a fundable business credit profile in 6-12 months with our system. Timeline breakdown: Months 1-3: Foundation setup, initial vendor accounts. Months 3-6: Additional vendor accounts, retail business credit cards. Months 6-9: Bank business credit cards, higher limits. Months 9-12: Business lines of credit, term loans, equipment financing. Some clients see approvals as early as 30-45 days, while accessing $50K-$150K typically takes the full 6-12 months.\n\nDo I Need an LLC or Corporation?\n\nWhile not legally required, having a formal business entity (LLC, Corporation, S-Corp) is strongly recommended and makes business credit building much easier and more effective. Sole proprietorships can technically build business credit, but you'll face more limitations and many lenders won't work with you without a formal business entity.\n\nWill This Affect My Personal Credit?\n\nWhen done correctly, building business credit has ZERO impact on your personal credit score. Applications, inquiries, and payment history all report under your business EIN—not your personal Social Security Number. This is one of the biggest advantages of business credit.\n\nWhat's the $50,000 Guarantee?\n\nWe guarantee that if you follow our program and maintain healthy financial behaviors, we'll continue working with you until you're approved for at least $50,000 in total business funding. This means we're committed to your success. We don't just hand you software and disappear—we stay with you until you hit that $50K threshold. The $50,000 funding guarantee is based on our advisor team assisting you with securing several credit approvals, totaling at least $50,000, through each tier of funding.\n\nWhat's the Difference Between Full Service and DIY?\n\nFull Service Program ($2,495): 12 months of dedicated business credit coaching, weekly check-in calls with your advisor, custom strategy development, priority support, accountability partnership, and $50K funding guarantee. D.I.Y. Program ($995): Complete Business Credit Finance Suite software access, all educational materials and training, email support from funding specialists, self-paced learning, no coaching calls. Both programs include the same software, education, and access to our 300+ vendor/lender network. The difference is the level of guidance and support.\n\nCan I Do This Without Your Program?\n\nTechnically, yes. However, most business owners who try to DIY business credit either fail or take 18-24+ months because they don't know: the proper sequence of applications, which vendors actually report to bureaus, credit bureau reporting requirements, how to optimize approval odds, when to move from one tier to the next. Our program compresses the timeline to 6-12 months and significantly increases success rates because we've already figured out what works.\n\nReady to Build Business Credit That\nOpens Doors to Real Funding?\n\nStop risking your personal assets.

Invoice factoring is best for B2B companies with outstanding invoices and accepts the lowest credit scores (530+). Startups with no business history should look at our STARTUP programs (680+ credit required). Established businesses (2+ years, 650+ credit, $20K+/mo revenue) qualify for term loans and credit lines. Real estate investors need 620+ credit but can access up to $100M. Equipment-heavy businesses can get $1K-$20M with 700+ credit. Mesa Group Capital will help you identify the best fit during your consultation.\n\nHow fast can I get funded?\n\nTimeline varies by funding type. Business Cash Advances and Merchant Cash Advances can fund same-day to 48 hours. Invoice Factoring typically funds within 24-48 hours. Business Lines of Credit and STARTUP programs: 3-7 business days. SBA loans and Real Estate financing: 2-6 weeks. During your consultation, we'll set clear expectations based on your chosen funding solution.\n\nWhat if my credit score is below 680?\n\nYou still have options! Invoice Factoring accepts credit scores as low as 530+. Business Cash Advances accept 550+ credit. Real Estate Investment loans accept 620+ credit. If your credit is below these thresholds, we can help you work on credit improvement strategies while exploring alternative funding sources. Mesa Group Capital specializes in matching businesses with lenders regardless of credit challenges.\n\nDo I need collateral?\n\nIt depends on the funding type. Unsecured options (no collateral): Business Cash Advances, Business Lines of Credit, STARTUP programs, and some term loans. Secured options (collateral required): Equipment Financing uses the equipment as collateral. Real Estate loans use the property as collateral. SBA loans may require collateral for larger amounts. We always prioritize unsecured options first to protect your assets.\n\nCan I get funding if my business is brand new (no history)?\n\nYes! Our 2 STARTUP programs are designed specifically for businesses with ZERO time in business. The STARTUP Unsecured Business Funding (up to $150K) and STARTUP Small Business Loan (up to $150K) only require personal credit of 680+ and some verifiable personal income. No business tax returns, no years of operation required. Perfect for launching your first venture.\n\nHow much will the funding cost me?\n\nCost varies significantly by funding type, credit profile, and lender. Business term loans and SBA loans typically have APRs of 6-12%. Business Lines of Credit: 8-20% APR. Merchant Cash Advances and Invoice Factoring: factor rates of 1.1-1.5 (not APR). Equipment Financing: 5-15% depending on collateral. STARTUP programs: 10-25% depending on credit. We'll provide transparent cost breakdowns for all options during your consultation so you can make an informed decision.\n\nWhat documents do I need to apply?\n\nBasic requirements for most programs: Driver's License or ID, 3-6 months of business bank statements, Business tax returns (if applicable), Personal credit authorization. Additional documents may be needed for specific programs (e.g., equipment quotes for equipment financing, invoices for invoice factoring, property details for real estate). Mesa Group Capital will provide a complete checklist during your consultation.\n\nCan I apply for multiple funding types at once?\n\nYes, and we often recommend it! Many businesses benefit from combining multiple funding sources. For example: 0% Business Credit Line + Equipment Financing + Invoice Factoring for comprehensive capital coverage. Mesa Group Capital coordinates timing and applications to maximize approvals while minimizing credit inquiry impacts. We call this 'Strategic Funding Combinations.'\n\nWhat industries does Mesa Group Capital work with?\n\nWe work with virtually all industries, but certain funding types favor specific sectors. Invoice Factoring: B2B services, contractors, staffing agencies, wholesalers. Equipment Financing: manufacturing, construction, healthcare, transportation. Merchant Cash Advances: retail, restaurants, service providers. Real Estate: fix-and-flip investors, commercial property buyers, multi-family developers. STARTUP programs: all industries. If you're unsure whether your industry qualifies, schedule a consultation—we'll find the right option.\n\nIs Mesa Group Capital a direct lender?\n\nNo, Mesa Group Capital is a business funding brokerage. This means we have relationships with 30+ funding partners and lenders, enabling us to match your business with the ideal funding source for your specific needs and profile. As a brokerage, we provide strategic guidance and handle the application process on your behalf, often achieving better terms than you'd get applying directly. There's no cost to you—we're compensated by the lenders.\n\nPicture Your Business Thriving. See Yourself Seizing Every Opportunity.\n\nImagine accepting that major contract without hesitation.

Now it's time to fuel what's next.\n\nEvery business owner knows the feeling—the gap between where you are and where you could be isn't about ideas or effort. It's about capital. Whether you're hiring your first employee, upgrading equipment, or expanding to that second location, the right funding at the right time changes everything.\n\nThrough our brokerage division, Mesa Group Capital, we connect you with a curated network of 75+ specialized lenders—each offering different products, terms, and approval criteria. We don't just submit applications. We architect funding solutions that match your business reality.\n\nSchedule Free Consultation\nReady to Apply Now →\nPowered by\nInteractive Funding Calculator\nHow Much Funding Could Your Business Qualify For?\n\nMost lenders approve 10-20% of your annual revenue for unsecured funding. See your estimated range instantly:\n\nWhat's your annual business revenue?\n$\nCalculate My Funding Range\nSchedule Free Consultation\nApply Now →\n\nNote: This is an estimate. Your actual funding amount depends on credit profile, time in business, and industry. Our consultation will give you a precise assessment.\n\nWhy Most Business Funding Falls Short\n\nYou've probably heard the same story from every lender:\n\n\"Your business is too new\"\n\n\"Your revenue isn't consistent enough\"\n\n\"Come back when you have more collateral\"\n\nMeanwhile, competitors with deeper pockets are capturing the market opportunities you saw first. That contract you can't fulfill. The equipment upgrade that would double your capacity. The seasonal inventory that would set you up for your best quarter ever.\n\nThe irony? Banks say you need money to prove you can handle money.\n\nWe know better. Your business isn't a credit score—it's your life's work, your family's security, and your community's resource. That deserves funding partners who see the full picture.\n\nHow Mesa Group Capital Gets You Funded\n\nUnlike traditional lenders who fit businesses into rigid boxes, we start with a simple question: What would the right capital do for your business right now?\n\nThen we reverse-engineer the path to get you there.\n\nOur 3-Phase Funding Strategy\n1\nDiscovery & Diagnosis\nDeep-dive business assessment (not just paperwork review)\nCredit profile analysis (personal & business)\nRevenue pattern evaluation\nIndustry-specific opportunity mapping\n2\nStrategic Positioning\nOptimize your credit leverage points\nStructure your financials for maximum approval odds\nMatch you with the right lenders from our 75+ partner network\nPrepare application packages that tell your business story effectively\n3\nExecution & Funding\nSubmit to multiple compatible lenders simultaneously\nNegotiate terms on your behalf using our broker relationships\nCoordinate timing for optimal cash flow impact\nGuide you through closing and fund deployment\n\nThe result?

Apply Now\n\nSchedule Free Consultation\nApply Now\nSetting Realistic Expectations\nHow Much Funding Can You Actually Get?\n\nHere's the truth most brokers won't tell you upfront: your funding amount is tied directly to your revenue, not your dreams.\n\nThe 10-20% Rule:\n\nAs a general guideline, most lenders will approve funding equal to 10-20% of your annual revenue for unsecured products like lines of credit, term loans, and cash advances.\n\n$100K\n$10K-$20K typical funding range\n$500K\n$50K-$100K typical funding range\n$1M\n$100K-$200K typical funding range\nUse Our Calculator Above to See Your Range →\nWhy this matters:\n\nThis prevents you from wasting time chasing $100K in funding when your business generates $80K/year. It's not that lenders don't believe in your potential—it's that they're underwriting based on demonstrated cash flow, not projected growth.\n\nExceptions to this rule:\nSecured loans (equipment, real estate) can exceed this because collateral reduces lender risk\nSBA loans often allow higher multiples with strong credit and business plans\nInvoice factoring is based on receivables, not total revenue\nMultiple funding sources stacked together can push past 20% total\nThe smart approach:\n\nStart with funding that matches your current revenue. Deploy it strategically to grow. Then qualify for larger amounts based on your new, higher revenue. Many of our most successful clients have done 2-3 funding rounds, each larger than the last, as their business expanded.\n\nBottom line: We'd rather set realistic expectations upfront than promise $500K and deliver $50K.\n\nDuring your consultation, we'll give you an honest assessment of what funding amounts are realistic for your revenue level.\n\nSchedule Your Free Consultation\nReal Talk About Qualifications\n\nHere's what we've learned after funding 1,000+ businesses through Mesa Group Capital:\n\nThe listed minimums are guidelines, not absolutes.\n\nWe've secured funding for clients who didn't check every box because we:\n\nPositioned their application strategically\nFound lenders within our network who value their specific industry\nBuilt compensating factors into their profile\nTimed applications when their business showed momentum\n\nHowever, some fundamentals matter:\n\nCredit utilization above 30% makes approval more challenging across most lenders\nDebt-to-income ratios above 50% significantly limit available options\nNo credit history = no funding (you'll need established credit before applying)\n\nIf you're close but not quite there? We'll give you honest feedback during your consultation about what needs to improve before applying. In some cases, our sister company Mesa Group Consulting can help you build the credit foundation needed to qualify—but that's a separate service focused on long-term credit building, not a quick fix.\n\nCo-signers accepted: All funding types accept co-signers to strengthen applications.\n\nWhy Mesa Group Capital Gets Better Results\n\nMost Brokers Submit Your Application and Hope. We Engineer Your Approval.\n\n75+ Curated Lender Relationships\n\nWe know which lenders approve which profiles, what industries they prefer, and what red flags they overlook. No wasted applications, no credit inquiry damage.\n\nPre-Qualification Strategy\n\nWe test the waters with soft inquiries before committing your credit. Only submit formal applications when we know approval is likely.\n\nApplication Optimization\n\nHow you present your business matters as much as the numbers. We craft applications that get approved—highlighting strengths, addressing concerns proactively, and positioning you as a smart investment.\n\nTerms Negotiation\n\nMesa Group Capital has funded $50M+ in business loans through our network. Lenders give us terms they won't offer direct applicants because we bring them qualified, well-presented deals.\n\nPost-Funding Strategy\n\nGetting funded is step one. We show you how to use that capital to strengthen your profile and qualify for even better terms in your next funding round.\n\nFrom \"Maybe\" to \"Approved\" in 4 Simple Steps\n1\nFree Funding Consultation (30 minutes)\n\nWe'll discuss your business, what you need capital for, and your growth plans. Together, we'll determine which funding products from our network best match your situation and timeline. This consultation is completely free with no obligation.\n\nSchedule Your Consultation\n2\nFundability Assessment (2-3 days)\n\nWe review your credit profile and bank statements to verify fundability before submitting anything. This ensures we're positioning you for success and not wasting your time or damaging your credit with premature applications. We'll identify your strongest funding pathways and set realistic expectations for approval odds and terms.\n\n3\nNetwork Submission & Advisor Assignment (1-2 weeks)\n\nOnce we confirm you're fundable, we submit your application strategically across our 75+ lender network to secure your best offers. You'll be assigned a dedicated funding advisor and get access to our client portal where you can track progress, upload documents, and communicate directly with our team throughout the process.\n\nReady to skip the consultation? Apply directly here\n\n4\nFunding & Deployment (Timeline varies by product)\n\nAfter you select your preferred offer, we guide you through closing. Funds typically hit your account within 3-5 business days of final approval. Your funding advisor will provide guidance on optimal deployment strategies to maximize ROI and position you for future funding rounds if needed.\n\nReal Businesses, Real Results\nRated 5.0 Stars on Google\n\nBased on 200+ verified client reviews\n\n\"Mesa Group Capital got us $250K when three banks said no. Their broker relationships made the difference. We hired two employees, bought a second truck, and doubled revenue in six months. The team was transparent about timelines and delivered exactly what they promised.\"\n\n— Sarah M.\n\nConstruction Company Owner | Funded: $250,000\n\n\"Funded in 18 days after months of rejections.

I thought my credit was too damaged. They helped me understand what their lenders actually care about and which programs I qualified for. Got $75K for inventory through their factoring partner.

As a broker, we match you with lenders from our 75+ partner network whose criteria fits your business. Plus, we know how to present your application for maximum approval odds and negotiate better terms than you'd get directly.\n\nWill this hurt my credit score?\n\nWe pre-qualify without hard inquiries through our broker relationships. Only when we're confident of approval do we submit formal applications—and even then, multiple applications within 14-45 days typically count as one inquiry for credit scoring purposes.\n\nWhat if I've been denied before?\n\nPerfect—tell us why. Previous denials give us intel on what to fix or avoid. During your free consultation, we'll review what happened and give you honest feedback about whether you're ready to apply again or if you need to strengthen your profile first. Many of our best success stories through Mesa Group Capital are clients who were denied elsewhere but got approved once we positioned them correctly.\n\nHow much does this cost?\n\nNothing. Mesa Group Capital's services are completely free to business owners. We earn commissions directly from lenders when your funding closes. You pay no application fees, no upfront costs, and no hidden charges. We only get paid when you get funded.\n\nAre there really no application fees?\n\nCorrect. Unlike many brokers who charge application fees, we don't. Our entire compensation comes from the lender side of the transaction, which means our interests are perfectly aligned with yours—we both win when you get approved for the right funding at the best terms.\n\nHow fast can I get funded?\n\nCash advances: 24-48 hours. Lines of credit: 1-2 weeks. Term loans: 2-4 weeks. Real estate: 4-8 weeks. Speed depends on product type, lender workflow, and your documentation readiness.\n\nDo you work with startups?\n\nYes. Mesa Group Capital has specific lender partners for businesses under 2 years old. Requirements differ from established business funding, but we have pathways for entrepreneurs just getting started.\n\nWhat if my credit isn't good enough yet?\n\nWe'll be upfront during your fundability assessment. If you're not ready, we won't waste your time with applications that will get denied. In some cases, our sister company Mesa Group Consulting offers business credit building services to help you establish the foundation needed to qualify—but that's a separate engagement focused on long-term credit development.\n\nShould I schedule a consultation or apply directly?\n\nSchedule a consultation if: You've been denied before, you're unsure which product fits, your credit/revenue is borderline, or you want guidance on timing and strategy. Apply directly if: You know which product you want, you meet all the minimums clearly, and you're ready to move fast.\n\nWhat's the relationship between Mesa Group Consulting and Mesa Group Capital?\n\nMesa Group Consulting is our advisory firm that helps businesses build credit, optimize operations, and grow strategically. Mesa Group Capital is our brokerage division that connects businesses to our network of 75+ lenders. Often clients work with both—we help them become fundable, then connect them to capital.\n\nSchedule Consultation\nApply Now\nTwo Paths Forward\n\nNot Sure Where to Start?\n\nPath 1: Free Consultation First\n\n(Recommended for most businesses)\n\nBest if you:\nHave been denied before\nDon't know which product fits your situation\nWant to verify you're fundable before applying\nNeed guidance on timing and strategy\nHave credit or revenue concerns\nWhat happens:\n\n30-minute call → We assess your situation → Recommend best products → Set realistic expectations → If fundable, we apply for you\n\nSchedule Free Consultation\nPath 2: Apply Directly\n\n(For ready-to-go businesses)\n\nBest if you:\nKnow which product you want\nClearly meet all the requirements\nHave documentation ready\nWant to move fast (skip the consultation)\nWhat happens:\n\nComplete application → Assigned funding advisor → Submitted to our 75+ lender network → Receive multiple offers → Select best terms → Get funded\n\nStart Your Application\nYour Business Doesn't Have Time to Wait\n\nEvery day without the right funding is a day your competition moves ahead.

I would recommend him to my family and friends.\"\n\n— Business Owner, Bakersfield\n\n\"I got recommended from one of my family members that Evert is a very knowledgeable agent from Mesa Group Consulting which helped him establish a high credit score. I scheduled an appointment with Evert about my situation and we had a great conversation about improving my credit score.\"\n\n— Referred Client, Bakersfield\n\n\"Great service, Evert was able to get me approved on a 25 Grand Cherokee.\"\n\n— Auto Financing Client, Bakersfield\n\n\"Mesa Group secured $87,000 in 0% interest financing for my startup when traditional banks wouldn't even consider my application. The funding allowed me to purchase essential equipment and hire staff without worrying about crushing interest payments during our critical growth phase.\"\n\n— Daniel Rodriguez, Bakersfield Entrepreneur\n\nBusiness Funding Questions Answered\n\nGet clarity before you apply.\n\nWhat is 0% business funding, and how does it really work?\n\n0% business funding refers to business credit lines with promotional 0% APR for 12-18 months. During this period, you pay no interest on the borrowed amount—only the principal. This is similar to 0% credit card offers but designed for business use with much higher limits ($25K-$250K+). After the promotional period ends, standard interest rates apply to any remaining balance, so strategic businesses pay it off during the 0% window.\n\nWhat credit score do I need to qualify?\n\nIt depends on the funding type. For 0% business credit lines, we typically need personal credit scores of 680+. However, we have other funding options (merchant cash advances, invoice factoring, revenue-based financing) that accept scores as low as 550+. Even if your credit isn't perfect, we likely have options—that's why we work with 30+ funding partners with different requirements.\n\nHow much can I actually get approved for?\n\nFunding amounts vary based on your credit profile, business revenue, time in business, and industry. For 0% credit lines: typically $25,000 to $250,000. For business term loans: up to $5 million. For merchant cash advances: up to $10 million (for very high-volume businesses). We've secured $42M+ in funding for 720+ businesses, with individual approvals ranging from $10K to $2M+. Your specific approval amount will be determined during the consultation process.\n\nDo I need collateral or a down payment?\n\nMost of our 0% business credit lines and unsecured term loans require NO collateral. Equipment financing uses the equipment itself as collateral. SBA loans and larger term loans may require collateral depending on the amount. We always prioritize unsecured options first to protect your business and personal assets.\n\nHow long does the approval process take?\n\nTimeline varies by funding type. For 0% business credit lines: 3-7 business days typical. For merchant cash advances: same-day to 48 hours. For SBA loans or larger term loans: 2-6 weeks. During your consultation, we'll set clear timeline expectations based on your chosen funding solution.\n\nWhat can I use the funding for?\n\nYou can use business funding for ANY legitimate business purpose: equipment purchases, inventory, payroll, marketing, expansion, working capital, debt consolidation, hiring, office space, vehicles, technology, or any other operational need. There are no restrictions on how you deploy the capital.\n\nWill applying hurt my credit score?\n\nWe use strategic application management to minimize credit impacts. Initial consultations and soft credit checks don't affect your score. When we submit formal applications, there will be hard inquiries, but we coordinate timing to minimize the impact. Multiple inquiries for the same purpose within a 14-30 day window typically count as a single inquiry for scoring purposes.\n\nWhat happens after the 0% promotional period ends?\n\nAfter 12-18 months (depending on your specific terms), any remaining balance begins accruing interest at the standard APR (typically 15-25%). However, strategic businesses use the 0% period to grow revenue and pay down the principal before interest kicks in. We help you develop a repayment strategy during the deployment planning phase.\n\nDo you work with startups or only established businesses?\n\nYes, we work with startups! We have specialized startup funding programs that focus on personal credit rather than business history. While some funding types require 2+ years in business, our startup programs can work with businesses as new as 3-6 months old—or even pre-revenue in some cases.\n\nWhat makes Mesa Group different from other business funding companies?\n\nThree key differences: (1) We're a Bakersfield-based local company with deep community roots and accountability.

You Likely Qualify\nAccess $50,000 to $250,000+ in 0% Interest Capital Without Loans, Debt Payments, or Business Tax Returns\n\nWe show you how to leverage your personal credit to unlock business capital at 0% interest for 9-18 months. No monthly debt payments. No crushing interest. Just pure growth capital you can deploy however you need.\n\nNo business tax returns or financial statements required\nNo collateral required (unsecured credit lines)\n0% interest means every dollar works for you, not lenders\nStrategic bank relationships = higher approval rates\nCapital available in 30-60 days, not 6+ months\nBook Your Free Funding Consultation\nSee If You Qualify\nPowered by\n$155K\nAverage Funding Amount\n$47M+\nTotal Capital Secured\n850+\nClients Funded\n30-60\nDays To Capital\n15+\nYears Experience\nImagine Having $150,000 in Credit Available and Paying Zero Interest for 18 Months\n\nLet's talk real numbers. Here's what 0% capital actually means for your business.\n\nTraditional Business Loan at 9% APR\n$150K borrowed =\n$1,125/month in interest\nOver 18 months:\n$20,250 wasted on interest\n\nRequires:\n\n• 2+ years tax returns\n\n• 3-6 month approval process\n\nFixed monthly payments:\n\n$3,500+ whether you're making money or not\n\nMesa's 0% Funding Approach\n$150K at 0% APR =\n$0 in interest payments\nYou keep:\nAll $20,250 for growth\n\nRequires:\n\n• LLCs with 6+ months history\n\n• 700+ credit score\n\nMinimum payments:\n\n$50-100/month, preserving cash flow\n\nTimeline: 30-60 days to first capital\n\nBottom Line: That's $20,250 you keep to reinvest. While competitors hemorrhage cash on interest, you're building an empire.\n\n$47M+\nTotal 0% Capital Secured\n850+\nClients Funded\n$155K\nAverage Funding Amount\n30-60\nDays To First Capital\n15+\nYears Combined Banking Experience\nWhat Would You Do With $150,000 at 0% Interest Available Tomorrow?\n\nThis isn't just about capital. It's about what that capital makes possible.\n\nScale Without Suffocating\n\nHire that team. Launch that campaign. Buy that inventory. All without crushing loan payments killing your cash flow.\n\nReal Estate Investors: Move Fast\n\nPut $50K down on that flip while your competitor waits on hard money approval. Close deals in days, not weeks.\n\nLaunch That Second Business\n\nYou've had the idea for years. Now you have the capital to test it without risking everything.\n\nBuild Your War Chest\n\n6-12 months of operating expenses at 0% interest. Weather any storm with confidence.\n\nSeize Opportunities Instantly\n\nWhen time-sensitive deals appear, you don't scramble for funding. You already have it.\n\nEliminate High-Interest Debt\n\nTransfer $100K in 18% balances to 0% for 18 months. Save $27,000 in interest payments.\n\nWhy Mesa Clients Get 2x-6x More Capital Than Going It Alone\n\nAnyone can Google \"business credit cards.\" But random applications get random results. Our clients average $155K because we have what you can't Google.\n\n1\nBanking Industry Insider Knowledge\n\nOur CEO comes from a banking background and understands exactly how banks evaluate clients and underwrite decisions. We know what triggers approvals and what causes denials—because we've seen it from the inside.\n\nThe Result: We position your profile the exact way underwriters want to see it, maximizing your approval odds and credit limits.\n\n2\nDirect Banking Relationships\n\nWe maintain personal connections with Business Relationship Managers at Chase, Bank of America, US Bank, and 40+ regional banks. Your applications go through people who know us, not algorithms that reject you.\n\nThe Result: Higher approval rates, larger limits, reconsideration support when others get stuck.\n\n3\nStrategic Sequencing System\n\nThe order you apply matters. Which bureau each bank pulls matters. We've processed thousands of funding rounds and know exactly which banks to approach, when, and in what sequence.\n\nThe Result: Maximize total capital while protecting your credit profile from inquiry damage.\n\n4\nCredit Optimization Before Applications\n\nMost people apply before they're ready. We analyze your profile across all three bureaus and optimize every factor that impacts underwriting BEFORE we submit anything.\n\nThe Result: Position yourself for the highest limits possible—often $20K-$50K more per card.\n\nThis is why our clients average 2x-6x more funding than DIY attempts.\n\nOur Proven Three-Round Funding Framework\n\nStrategic sequencing across multiple rounds. Each success builds momentum for the next.\n\n1\nFoundation Round\n\nMajor national banks where our relationships are strongest. Establish your foundation and prove you can manage credit responsibly.\n\nTimeline: 30-60 Days\n\nExpected: $50K-$150K\n\n2\nExpansion Round\n\nWith payment history from Round 1, we tap our network of regional banks and specialized underwriters. Massive leverage happens here.\n\nTimeline: Days 60-120\n\nExpected: $50K-$150K Additional\n\n3\nMaximization Round\n\nFinal push leveraging your strong credit history and banking relationships. Institution-specific opportunities many miss completely.\n\nTimeline: Days 120-180\n\nExpected: $25K-$100K Additional\n\nWhy Three Rounds Instead of All at Once?\n\nBanks reward established customers and payment history. By spacing applications strategically, you build the exact profile that makes banks compete to give you their highest limits. Rush it, and you leave $50K-$100K on the table.\n\nIs 0% Business Funding Right for You?\nYou're a Great Fit If:\n\nYour personal credit score is 700 or higher\n\nThis system is built on personal creditworthiness. Below 700, approval rates and limits decrease significantly.\n\nYou can manage credit responsibly\n\nWe're giving you access to $150K+ at 0%. You need to pay on time and avoid overextending.\n\nYou need capital for legitimate business purposes\n\nGrowth, inventory, marketing, real estate, hiring, equipment—anything that moves your business forward.\n\nYou're willing to follow our system\n\nWe tell you what to do and when. Going rogue sabotages the process.\n\nThis ISN'T For You If:\n\nYour credit score is below 700\n\nWe can optimize your profile first, but you're not positioned for maximum approvals yet.\n\nYou have recent bankruptcies or major derogatory marks\n\nBanks won't approve you regardless of our relationships.\n\nYou're looking for \"free money\"\n\nThis is real credit requiring real responsibility.\n\nYou need money for personal expenses\n\nThis is business funding only.\n\nReal Clients. Real Results. Real Capital.\n\nSarah M.\n\nE-commerce Owner\n\nCredit Score\n\n735\n\nFunded\n\n$187,000\n\nTimeline\n\n90 Days\n\n\"I was stuck at $50K in revenue because I couldn't afford inventory at scale. Mesa helped me secure $187K at 0%. I 5x'd my inventory and hit $340K in revenue within 6 months. The 0% interest saved me $25K that hired two employees. This completely changed my trajectory.\"\n\nMarcus T.\n\nReal Estate Investor\n\nCredit Score\n\n698\n\nFunded\n\n$143,000\n\nTimeline\n\n75 Days\n\n\"Hard money was killing me at 12%. Mesa got me $143K at 0% in 75 days. I funded three flips simultaneously and made $89K profit. If I'd used hard money, interest would have eaten $15K-$18K. Now I close deals the day I find them.\"\n\nDavid K.\n\nSaaS Startup\n\nCredit Score\n\n762\n\nFunded\n\n$218,000\n\nTimeline\n\n105 Days\n\n\"VCs wanted 40% of my company. Instead, I got $218K at 0% and kept 100% ownership. Funded 9 months of development, hired three developers, launched, and hit $40K MRR. Now VCs chase us at a $15M valuation. Best decision I ever made.\"\n\nAcross 850+ Clients:\n$155,000\nAverage Funding\n$18K-$28K\nTypical Interest Saved\n94%\nSuccess Rate (720+ scores)\n38 days\nAvg Time to First Approval\nHere's Exactly What We Need to Get You Funded\nMinimum Requirements:\nPersonal credit score of 700+\nNo late payments in the past 12 months\nNo bankruptcies or charge-offs in the past 2 years\nAt least 2 years of credit history\nFewer than 5 inquiries per bureau in past 6 months\nActive business with 6+ months history (LLC, S-Corp, or Sole Proprietorship)\nIdeal Profile for Maximum Funding ($150K-$250K+):\nCredit score 750+\nMultiple credit account types (cards, auto, mortgage)\nCredit utilization under 10%\n5+ years of credit history\nClean inquiry profile (under 3 per bureau)\nExisting high-limit cards showing lender trust\nIf You Don't Qualify Yet:\n\nWe can help you get there. Our credit optimization program fixes utilization, removes inaccurate items, and positions your profile for maximum approvals. Typically takes 60-90 days.\n\nMost of our highest-funded clients started with scores in the 680-710 range. We optimized them to 720+ before Round 1, which is why they accessed significantly higher limits.\n\nYour Role in the Process\n\nWe handle applications, you follow our blueprint\n\nWhat We Handle:\nCredit profile analysis and optimization strategy\nSubmitting all funding applications on your behalf\nCoordinating directly with our banking contacts\nTiming all applications strategically across three rounds\nManaging inquiry distribution across all three bureaus\nGuiding you through pending reviews or reconsiderations\nTracking your progress and next steps\nIdentifying credit limit increase opportunities\nWhat You Handle:\n\nFollowing Our Banking Relationship Blueprint\n\nWe guide you through a specific sequence of relationship-building activities that position you as a priority client.\n\nMaintaining Strategic Communication\n\nWhen banks reach out for verification or due diligence, you'll handle those conversations using our positioning framework.\n\nManaging Your New Credit Lines\n\nYou're responsible for maintaining positive balances, making on-time minimum payments, and keeping the banking relationships we've helped you establish.\n\nProviding Required Documentation\n\nWhen we need documents (ID, business formation docs, bank statements), provide them promptly to keep your funding timeline on track.\n\nThe Bottom Line: This isn't passive—you're an active participant. But you're never guessing. We handle the applications and strategy. You follow our blueprint and maintain relationships. Think of it like having a personal trainer: We design the program and track progress. You show up and do the work. Together, we get results.\n\nOur Performance-Based Partnership Model\n\nWe only succeed when you succeed. You never pay for promises, only results.\n\nSmall Retainer to Begin\n\nA minimal upfront investment covers your comprehensive credit analysis across all three bureaus, custom funding roadmap, and full onboarding. This ensures we're both committed to your funding goals.\n\nSuccess Fee on Results Only\n\nOnce you're approved and funded, we earn a percentage of the total capital you receive. This means:\n\nWe're incentivized to maximize your approvals\nYou only pay when you get actual results\nOur interests are 100% aligned\nNo funding = no success fee\nThe ROI Reality\n\nWhen you're accessing $150K at 0% instead of paying 9-15% on traditional loans, the math is compelling. Most clients save 3-5x their program investment in interest payments alone.\n\nExample: $150,000 at 0% vs. 9% traditional loan\n\n= $20,250 saved in interest over 18 months\n\nThat's real money staying in your business for growth instead of going to lenders.\n\nWhat You Get\nComplete credit analysis across all three bureaus\nCustom funding roadmap tailored to your profile\nCredit optimization included (if needed)\nGuided execution through all three rounds\nDirect access to our banking relationships\nReconsideration support and bureau management\nOngoing credit limit increase coaching\n\nYour exact investment and personalized funding projection will be covered in detail during your free consultation.\n\nWhat Happens After You've Maxed Out 0% Funding?\n\nOnce you've deployed 0% capital and proven your business model works at scale, bigger funding options open up:\n\nBank Statement Loans\n\n$50K-$500K\n\nAfter 3-6 months of using your 0% capital, you'll have business cash flow in bank statements. This qualifies you for larger loans based on deposits, not tax returns.\n\nTraditional Business Lines of Credit\n\nVaries\n\nWith established revenue and banking relationships from our program, you can access revolving credit with better terms.\n\nSBA Loans & Full-Doc Funding\n\nMajor Expansion\n\nOnce you have 2+ years of tax returns showing strong revenue (built with your 0% capital), SBA loans become available for major expansion.\n\nMesa Group Consulting can guide you through all of these when you're ready. The 0% program is the fastest way to get capital NOW. Everything else builds from there.\n\nQuestions? We've Heard Them All.\nIs this even legal?\n\n100% legal. We're leveraging business credit cards with promotional 0% APR periods. Banks WANT to give you these cards. We just maximize approval amounts through our relationships and positioning.\n\nWill this hurt my credit score?\n\nEach application creates a hard inquiry (2-5 point temporary drop). However, we manage inquiry distribution strategically across all three bureaus. Most clients see scores INCREASE by 20-40 points after Round 1 due to new accounts with high limits and low utilization.\n\nWhat if I get denied?\n\nOur optimization and banking relationships dramatically reduce denials. If you do get denied, we guide you through reconsideration—often converting denials to approvals. We have backup banks for every round. One denial doesn't kill the process.\n\nDo I need an established business with revenue?\n\nNo. These are 'no-doc' approvals based on personal credit, not business financials. LLCs with 6+ months of history qualify immediately. You don't even need business revenue yet.\n\nWhat if I don't have great credit?\n\nIf your score is 700-719, you'll likely qualify but may get lower limits ($65K-$130K range). If you're below 700, we recommend our credit optimization program first. We can usually get you to 720+ within 60-90 days, then proceed with funding.\n\nHow is this different from just applying for cards myself?\n\nThree major differences: (1) We submit applications on your behalf through our banking relationships—your applications go through people who know us, not just online portals. (2) Our strategic sequencing and bureau management prevents inquiry damage while maximizing total approvals. (3) Our optimization process positions you for maximum limits before we submit anything. DIY attempts typically result in 40-60% of the funding you'd get with our system and relationships.\n\nWhat happens when the 0% period ends?\n\nYou have options: (1) Pay off the balance before interest kicks in. (2) Transfer the balance to another 0% card (we help you find these). (3) Convert it to a low-interest business loan. (4) Keep it as a revolving line if needed. We track all your promotional periods and help you plan the best strategy.\n\nCan I use this for real estate investing?\n\nAbsolutely. Many of our clients are real estate investors using 0% capital for down payments, renovations, or holding costs. $50K at 0% can fund multiple fix-and-flips without the crushing interest of hard money loans.\n\nWhat if I already have some business credit cards?\n\nPerfect. We'll incorporate your existing cards into the strategy and focus on getting you NEW lines at the highest limits. Having existing cards often helps with approvals.\n\nHow much time does this take from me?\n\nRound 1 requires about 5-10 hours of your time spread over 30-60 days: following our banking blueprint, answering verification calls, providing documents. Rounds 2 and 3 are even easier because the foundation is established.\n\nWhat if I miss a payment?\n\nYour 0% rate disappears, and you get hit with penalty APR (typically 29.99%). This is why we emphasize: if you can't manage credit responsibly, this program isn't for you. The upside is massive, but you must make minimum payments on time.\n\nIs there a guarantee?\n\nWe only get paid when you get funded. Our retainer covers your analysis and strategy—the real success fee only comes when you receive actual approvals. We've never had a client with a 720+ score fail to get at least $50K in Round 1. If your score is 700-719, we'll be upfront about realistic expectations during your consultation.\n\nYou Have Two Choices Right Now\n1\nKeep Doing What You've Been Doing\nKeep applying for traditional loans with 9-15% interest rates\nKeep waiting 3-6 months for funding decisions\nKeep watching $20,000+ per year vanish into interest payments\n2\nAccess $150K at 0% Interest in 30-60 Days\nLet us show you exactly how much 0% capital you can access\nGet the funding you need without crushing debt payments\nBuild your business with capital that costs you nothing\nOur Banking Relationships Are Capacity-Limited\n\nTo maintain our high approval rates and personalized service, we only take on 15-20 new clients per month. This ensures every client gets the attention their funding deserves and our banking contacts aren't overwhelmed with applications.\n\nCurrent availability for December 2024: 7 spots remaining\n\nBook Your Free Funding Consultation Now\n\nOn this 30-minute call, you'll get:\n\nComplete credit analysis across all 3 bureaus\nYour exact funding potential ($50K-$250K range)\nCustom roadmap with timeline\nHonest assessment (we'll tell you if you're not ready)\n\nThe consultation is free.

This is our commitment to you: genuine debt reduction, not just restructuring.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nGet answers to common questions about business debt relief and our program.\n\nDoes my company need debt restructuring?\n\nOur program is best suited for business owners who: (1) Can't afford existing debt payments but want to pay them off at a realistic pace, (2) Need to protect assets from aggressive creditors without filing bankruptcy, (3) Don't want to go deeper into debt by borrowing again at high, unsustainable rates. If you're struggling with cash flow due to debt payments, you likely qualify.\n\nHow does the debt relief process work?\n\nWe take your large amount of unaffordable debt and make it affordable. You provide your budget—what you can realistically afford monthly—and we use that to negotiate settlements with creditors ranging from pennies on the dollar to payment in full. There are no time limits for settlements. Some creditors settle quickly after our first offers, others take longer. Most importantly, you refer harassing collection calls to us so you can focus on your business.\n\nWhat types of business debt do you handle?\n\nAll types of business debts including cash advances (MCA), credit cards, suppliers/vendors, business loans, leases, tax debts (IRS/state), and equipment financing. We routinely settle lawsuits, judgments, and secured debts as well—even those with personal guarantees. If it's a business debt causing financial hardship, we can likely help.\n\nHow much will it cost me to restructure my debt?\n\nWe don't promise specific outcomes, but clients who completed our program paid back 89% of their debt over 35 months on average—including the cost of our services. This means if you owed $100,000, you'd pay approximately $89,000 total (including our fees) instead of the full $100,000. We charge NO upfront fees—our fees are performance-based and only charged as debts successfully settle.\n\nHow long will it take to complete the program?\n\nOur clients finish the program between 2-4 years typically—sometimes faster, sometimes slower. The more you pay monthly, the faster you'll be debt-free. However, we encourage clients to commit to paying as little as necessary because when cash flow is tight, it's better to pay back less than more. If your cash flow improves, you can always increase payments and finish faster.\n\nWhat reporting and updates can I expect?\n\nAs our client, you'll have 24/7 access to your secure online dashboard with over a dozen reports including: your restructuring team's background, comprehensive creditor reports showing negotiation status, monthly transaction statements, rate of funding, payment schedules, needed documentation, net savings vs. net cost analysis, and a 'finish line' tracker showing remaining debt and timeline to completion.\n\nHow will the program affect my business credit?\n\nThe truth is clients may have to temporarily sacrifice their credit score to save their business. Whether in our program or not, credit scores will decline if debts aren't paid on time. Our goal is to get you out of debt with payments you can actually afford so you can save your business and continue providing for your family. Once debts are settled and cash flow improves, you can rebuild business credit.\n\nWhat's the difference between debt relief and bankruptcy?\n\nBankruptcy forces you to liquidate assets, damages your business reputation for 7-10 years, requires expensive attorney fees ($3,000-$10,000+), and you lose control of the process. Debt relief lets you settle debts for less, protect your assets, keep the process private, and maintain business operations. You stay in control and avoid the stigma of bankruptcy.\n\nCan I continue operating my business during the program?\n\nYes! That's the whole point. Unlike bankruptcy which may force liquidation, our debt relief program is designed to let you continue business operations while we negotiate settlements. You'll have improved cash flow from reduced debt payments, allowing you to focus on revenue generation rather than debt management.\n\nWhat if creditors sue me or get a judgment?\n\nWe routinely handle lawsuits and judgments as part of our program. Even if a creditor has already sued you or obtained a judgment, we can still negotiate settlements. In many cases, we resolve legal actions for significantly less than the judgment amount. The key is acting quickly before garnishments or levies begin—book your free consultation now.\n\nDo I qualify for business debt relief?\n\nYou may qualify if: (1) You have at least $10,000 in business debt, (2) You're experiencing financial hardship or struggling with payments, (3) You can commit to a monthly payment toward settlements based on your budget, and (4) Your debts are with creditors who negotiate settlements. The only way to know for sure is to book a free consultation—we'll review your situation and provide a customized recommendation.\n\nAre there any upfront costs or fees?\n\nNO. We charge zero upfront fees. Our fees are performance-based, meaning you only pay as debts successfully settle. This aligns our interests with yours—we don't get paid unless we deliver results. During your free consultation, we'll explain our complete fee structure transparently so you know exactly what to expect.\n\nPicture Your Business Thriving. Imagine Cash Flow That Lets You Breathe Again.\n\nImagine checking your account and seeing profit instead of red. Taking that growth opportunity without hesitation. Sleeping through the night knowing creditors are settled and your business is protected. Telling your family the storm is over—you not only survived, you're positioned to thrive. That financial freedom you deserve is one decision away.\n\nStart Your Debt-Free Journey\nPowered by\n30-50% Debt Reduction\nNo Upfront Fees\n2-4 Year Program\nFree Consultation\nNo Obligation\n100% Confidential\nAvoid Bankruptcy\nStop Creditor Calls\nStop Drowning in Debt.\nStart Building Your Business Future.\n\nYou've worked too hard to let debt destroy everything you've built.
