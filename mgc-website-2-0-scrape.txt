Watch: Why Mesa Group Is Different

45-90 second founder video • Evert Calderon

You Deserve Better Than This

Getting denied for that apartment while the landlord looked at you like you're irresponsible.

Watching your friends book trips with credit card rewards while you're stuck paying cash for everything.

That sick feeling in your stomach every time you apply for something—knowing the rejection is coming before you even hit submit.

The stress of being one emergency away from financial catastrophe. The shame of pulling out your debit card while everyone else swipes credit. The weight of knowing your financial past is stealing your financial future.

This isn't about a number on a report. This is about your dignity. Your opportunities. Your family's future.

And it ends here.

Featured in local and national media for our proven financial solutions

We Did the Heavy Lifting. You Get the Results.

You've spent enough time feeling stuck. Enough nights lying awake wondering how you'll ever get ahead. Enough years watching everyone else build wealth while you're just trying to survive.

That cycle breaks today.

Most people navigate their financial lives across dozens of disconnected platforms—one for credit monitoring, another for loans, a third for estate planning. It's inefficient, confusing, and leaves critical gaps in your strategy.

But here's what really costs you:

The hours wasted researching which companies are legitimate. The money lost on trial-and-error with the wrong services. The opportunities missed because you didn't know where to start.

Mesa Group eliminates all of that.

We've spent years building relationships with the nation's premier financial service providers—from credit restoration platforms to business funding networks to estate planning technologies. We've negotiated access, vetted their credibility, and integrated them into a single, cohesive ecosystem.

We did the homework. We made the connections. We built the shortcuts.

You get the results.

The Cost of Going It Alone

10+ hours researching which platforms are trustworthy

WITH MESA GROUP
Instant access to vetted, industry-leading platforms
A clear roadmap built specifically for your situation
Expert guidance at every step—no more guessing

You check your credit score...

+100 points.

Collections? Gone.

Your report? Clean.

That apartment you've been eyeing...

Approved.

The keys are yours.

You walk into the dealership...

Not with dread. With confidence.

The finance manager is smiling.

"We're buying a house."

They don't have to move again.

You're building something
they can inherit.

This isn't a fantasy. This is what happens when you have the right partner.

You stop living paycheck to paycheck because you consolidated that debt at a fraction of the interest.

This is the freedom good credit creates.

You stop losing sleep because you have estate planning in place—your family is protected.

This is the opportunity smart money decisions unlock.

You stop wondering "what if" because you secured that business funding and finally launched.

This is the legacy Mesa Group helps you build.

Your financial past doesn't have to define your financial future.
Not anymore.

Why Families Choose Mesa Group When Everything Else Has Failed

You've tried fixing it yourself. You've looked at other companies. You've spent money on services that promised results and delivered excuses.

We get it. Trust is earned, not given.

Here's why 2,500+ families decided Mesa Group was different—and why they were right.

We've Actually Been There

Most financial companies are run by people who've never struggled with bad credit. Never been denied. Never felt the shame of financial rejection.

Not us.

Our founder had a 490 credit score. Failed business. Nearly empty bank account. He watched his immigrant parents almost lose their home and everything they built when they risked coming to this country. He knows what it feels like to be stuck.

That's why Mesa Group operates different. We're not here to judge you. We're here to guide you—because we've walked the exact path you're on right now.

You're not talking to salespeople. You're talking to people who understand.

We Built the Shortcuts You Need

You know what separates people who succeed from people who stay stuck? Information.

The wealthy have financial advisors, estate planners, CPAs, credit specialists, funding networks. They have access.

Mesa Group gives you that same access.

We spent years building relationships with SmartCredit, SuperMoney, Novae, and more. We negotiated partnerships so you get enterprise-level tools without enterprise-level prices.

The shortcuts the wealthy use? Now they're yours too.

Your Success is Our Success

Here's the difference between Mesa Group and everyone else:

Other companies: Get paid whether you succeed or not. They take your money upfront, deliver mediocre results, and move on.

Mesa Group: We only win when you win. Our reputation is built on your transformation. Your referrals. Your success stories.

That's why we work harder. That's why we care more. That's why we've maintained a perfect 5-star rating across 150+ Google reviews.

When you succeed, you tell people. And that's how we grow.

We're not here to make a quick buck. We're here to build generational relationships with families who trust us with their financial futures.

That trust? We protect it with everything we have.

Why I Built Mesa Group—And Why It Had to Exist

At 25, I had bad credit, a failed business, and nearly nothing in the bank.

But that's not even the painful part.

The painful part was watching my immigrant parents almost lose their home in 2008—not because they were lazy or irresponsible, but because no one ever explained how the financial system worked. They worked two jobs. They paid their bills. They did everything they were supposed to do.

And the system still almost crushed them.

I watched my family file bankruptcy in the early 2000s. I saw what it did to them—the stress, the shame, the feeling of failure even though they worked harder than anyone I knew.

When I tried to start my own life, I repeated the same mistakes. Credit cards I didn't understand. Loans I couldn't afford. A business that collapsed under debt I didn't know how to manage.

I'll never forget the feeling of checking my credit score for the first time: 490.

I felt like a failure. Like I'd let my family down. Like I was destined to repeat their struggle.

But then I realized something that changed everything:

Bad credit doesn't mean you're irresponsible. It means no one taught you.

And if no one taught my parents—hardworking immigrants who risked everything to come to this country and build a life—then how many other families were out there navigating this system blind?

That's why I built Mesa Group.

So it could be the strategic financial partner my family never had when we needed it most.

Today, we've helped over 2,500 families and businesses. We've facilitated over $100M in funding through our partner networks. We've turned 490 credit scores into mortgage approvals. We've turned denied loan applications into funded businesses.

But here's what I'm most proud of:

Every single client we've helped is now equipped to teach the next generation. They understand how credit works. They know how to access capital. They can build wealth that lasts.

That's the real legacy. Not fixing credit—breaking generational curses.

— Evert Jafet Calderon, Founder & CEO

Why "Mesa"? Because Money Should Be Discussed at the Table—Not Hidden from It.

In most households, there's an unspoken rule: you don't talk about money at the dinner table. Finances are private. Struggles stay hidden. Pride keeps the conversation closed, and the cycle continues.

Mesa Group was founded to change that.

"Mesa" means table. We named this company to challenge that silence.

What if families actually sat down and talked about credit? About debt? About building something for the next generation? What if there was someone at that table who understood the struggle—and could show you the way forward without judgment?

That's what we built.

Mesa Group Consulting was founded by a first-generation American who watched his immigrant parents navigate a financial system no one explained to them. He saw the foreclosure notices. The bankruptcy filing. The sacrifices they made because they didn't know there was another way.

And when he tried to start his own life, he made the same mistakes.

Credit completely shot. Failed business. Nearly empty bank account. No guidance. No blueprint. Just the belief that there had to be a better way.

That journey—from financial rock bottom to building a company that has helped thousands of families take control of their future—is the foundation of everything we do.

Today, Mesa Group serves clients from all backgrounds and walks of life. Because bad credit doesn't discriminate, and neither do we.

Whether you're a young professional trying to build from scratch, a parent trying to buy your first home, or someone rebuilding after life knocked you down—you deserve guidance that meets you where you are.

That's why we exist.

The Man Behind Mesa: Why This Is Personal

At 25, Evert had bad credit, a failed business, and nearly nothing in the bank.

But that's not even the painful part.

The painful part was watching his immigrant parents almost lose their home—not because they were lazy or irresponsible, but because no one ever explained how the financial system worked. They worked two jobs. They paid their bills. They did everything they were supposed to do.

And the system still almost crushed them.

Evert watched his family file bankruptcy in the early 2000s. He saw what it did to them—the stress, the shame, the feeling of failure even though they worked harder than anyone he knew.

When he tried to start his own life, he repeated the same mistakes. Credit cards he didn't understand. Loans he couldn't afford. A business that collapsed under debt he didn't know how to manage.

The day he checked his credit for the first time? It was rock bottom.

He felt like a failure. Like he'd let his family down. Like he was destined to repeat their struggle.

But then he realized something that changed everything:

Bad credit doesn't mean you're irresponsible. It means no one taught you.

And if no one taught his parents—hardworking immigrants who risked everything to come to this country and build a life—then how many other families were out there navigating this system blind?

That's why he built Mesa Group.

Not to build a business. To build a movement—one family at a time.

He built it to be the strategic financial partner his family never had when they needed it most.

Let's Talk About Your Financial Goals
The Results

Today, Mesa Group has:

Helped 2,500+ families and businesses transform their finances
Facilitated over $100M in funding through partner networks
Turned denied applications into mortgage approvals
Turned failed businesses into funded success stories
Built a perfect 5-star rating across 150+ Google reviews

But here's what Evert is most proud of:

Every single client Mesa Group has helped is now equipped to teach the next generation. They understand how credit works. They know how to access capital. They can build wealth that lasts.

That's the real legacy. Not fixing credit—breaking generational curses.

This isn't just business for Evert. This is personal. This is his family's story.

And it's probably yours too.

Our Mission: Financial Freedom for Every Generation

To provide fast, ethical, and empowering financial solutions that help people across all generations and backgrounds take control of their credit, funding, and financial future.

We are deeply committed to serving first-generation families and communities that traditional financial services have historically overlooked.

We help the younger generation avoid the mistakes we made. We show the older generation that it's never too late to start. And we treat every client—whether they walk in with a 300 or an 800—with the same respect and dedication.

Three Promises We Make
To the Young Professional Building from Scratch

You won't repeat the mistakes your parents made—not on our watch. We'll teach you how to build credit the right way from day one, so by the time you're ready to buy your first home or start your business, you're approved—not denied.

To the Parent Fighting for Your Family

You deserve that mortgage approval. You deserve to stop paying someone else's mortgage with your rent. You deserve to build something your kids can inherit. We'll show you the path from where you are to where you want to be.

To the Entrepreneur Rebuilding After Setbacks

Your past failures don't define your future success. Bankruptcy, divorce, medical debt, business collapse—we've seen it all, and we've helped people come back stronger. Your comeback story starts here.

Ready to Start Your Journey?
Rooted in Faith, Family, and Financial Freedom

These aren't just words on a wall. They're the principles that guide every decision we make and every conversation we have.

Family First

We treat our clients like family because that's how we were raised.

Every conversation and strategy comes from a place of respect, loyalty, and commitment to lifting each other up. When you work with Mesa, you're not just a client. You're part of the family.

What this means for you:

No judgment. Ever. We've been where you are.
We celebrate your wins like they're our own
We stay with you through the entire journey—not just the transaction
Faith-Led Purpose

Everything we do is rooted in service, compassion, and belief.

Belief in God. Belief in community. Belief in the power of new beginnings. Faith guides our vision and reminds us that we're building something bigger than ourselves.

"Where God guides, He provides." — Isaiah 58:11

What this means for you:

We operate with integrity because we answer to a higher standard
We believe your breakthrough is already written—we're just here to help you walk it out
We pray for our clients' success as much as we strategize for it
Integrity Always

We move with honesty and transparency, even when it's inconvenient.

Our clients trust us with their future, and we never take that lightly. No shortcuts. No broken promises. No illegal tactics. Just real results built on real ethics.

What this means for you:

We tell you what we CAN do and what we CAN'T do—upfront
We comply with every federal regulation (FCRA, CROA, TSR)
If we can't help you, we'll tell you that too—and point you in the right direction
Education Over Shortcuts

Anyone can file a dispute. We teach you why it matters.

Real transformation happens when you understand how credit actually works, not just how to fix it temporarily. Our goal isn't just to repair your credit. It's to make sure you never need us again.

What this means for you:

You'll understand every step of the process
You'll learn how to maintain and protect your credit long after we're done
You'll be equipped to teach the next generation what no one taught you
Experience the Mesa Difference
Where We're Going: Redefining Financial Success

To redefine what financial success looks like for first-generation families and underserved communities by making credit, ownership, and wealth-building tools accessible, practical, and empowering for everyone.

We envision a future where:

Young people have the knowledge to build early
Older generations are given the confidence to restart
Families break financial cycles for good

Mesa Group exists to shift the mindset from survival to ownership, one legacy at a time.

The Impact We're Creating

By 2030, our vision is to have helped:

10,000+ families achieve homeownership who thought it was impossible
5,000+ businesses access the capital they need to scale
50,000+ individuals understand credit well enough to never fall into the same traps again

But the real measure of our success?

When your kids don't have to Google "how to fix bad credit" because you already taught them how to build it right.

When your grandkids inherit wealth instead of debt.

When "financial literacy" isn't some fancy term—it's just what your family does.

That's the Mesa legacy.

How We're Different: Education First, Sales Never

Most financial companies care about commissions. We care about your transformation.

We've Actually Been There

Most financial companies are run by people who've never struggled with bad credit. Never been denied. Never felt the shame of financial rejection.

Not us.

Our founder had credit completely shot. Failed business. Nearly empty bank account. He watched his immigrant parents almost lose their home.

That's why Mesa Group operates differently. We're not here to judge you. We're here to guide you—because we've walked the exact path you're on right now.

We Built the Shortcuts You Need

You know what separates people who succeed from people who stay stuck? Information.

The wealthy have financial advisors, estate planners, CPAs, credit specialists, funding networks. They have access.

Mesa Group gives you that same access.

We spent years building relationships with SmartCredit, SuperMoney, Novae, and more. We negotiated partnerships so you get enterprise-level tools without enterprise-level prices.

The shortcuts the wealthy use? Now they're yours too.

Your Success Is Our Success

Here's the difference between Mesa Group and everyone else:

Other companies: Get paid whether you succeed or not. They take your money upfront, deliver mediocre results, and move on.

Mesa Group: We only win when you win. Our reputation is built on your transformation. Your referrals. Your success stories.

That's why we work harder. That's why we care more. That's why we've maintained a perfect 5-star rating across 150+ reviews.

When you succeed, you tell people. And that's how we grow.

Why Our Team Makes the Difference

Notice something about our team? We're not just multilingual—we're multicultural. We understand the unique financial challenges facing Hispanic/Latino families, Punjabi communities, and first-generation Americans because many of us have lived them.

When you call Mesa Group, you're not getting a call center in another state reading from a script. You're getting a real person in Bakersfield who understands your culture, speaks your language, and genuinely cares about helping you build the financial future you deserve.

That's the Mesa difference.

Giving Back to the Communities That Built Us

Mesa Group was built in Bakersfield, California—a city often overlooked, but full of hardworking families who deserve better financial opportunities.

We serve:

Hispanic/Latino families through Mesa Financiera (Spanish-language services)
Punjabi community through Chaklo Credit (Punjabi/English services)
First-generation Americans navigating a financial system no one explained to them
Small business owners who've been turned down by traditional banks

We provide trilingual support (English, Spanish, Punjabi) because financial education should never be limited by language.

Your Financial Transformation Starts with One Conversation

2,500+ families have already made the decision. They're building credit. Accessing capital. Protecting legacies. Breaking cycles.

What are you waiting for?

Every day you wait is another day:

•
Paying higher interest rates than you should
•
Getting denied for opportunities you deserve
•
Watching others build wealth while you stay stuck
•
Letting your financial past steal your financial future

You can't change what happened yesterday. But you can change what happens tomorrow.

It starts right here. Right now.

Financial Solutions Built for Real People, Real Situations

Life doesn't follow a straight line, and neither does your financial journey. Maybe you've had some setbacks. Maybe no one ever taught you how credit actually works. Maybe you're just looking for better options than what the banks are offering.

Here's what matters: where you start doesn't determine where you finish.

Mesa Group Consulting exists to guide you from wherever you are to wherever you want to be—with transparency, respect, and practical solutions that actually work. No corporate jargon. No hidden fees. No treating you like a credit score instead of a person.

We've been where you are. We understand the stress, the confusion, and the frustration of navigating a financial system that wasn't designed with you in mind. That's exactly why we built something different.

Bad Credit Is Costing You Thousands—Every Month

A low credit score isn't just a number. It's the difference between a 4% mortgage rate and an 8% rate—costing you $200,000+ over 30 years.

It's getting denied for that business loan. Paying $3,000 deposits on apartments. Being passed over for jobs (yes, employers check credit).

Here's the truth: Most negative items on your credit report contain errors, outdated information, or unverifiable data. Under federal law (FCRA), you have the right to challenge these items.

But navigating disputes with Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion? Tracking responses? Negotiating with creditors? It's a full-time job.

That's where we come in.

78% of credit reports contain errors or outdated information

— Federal Trade Commission Study

Tired of Missing Opportunities Because of Credit Report Errors?

Every loan denial. Every "sorry, you don't qualify." Every night worrying your past mistakes will follow you forever. You know some of those items aren't even accurate—but the bureaus won't listen when you try to fix it yourself. Your dreams are on hold while your credit stays broken.

We can only remove inaccurate, unverifiable, or unfair items.

If an item is 100% accurate and properly reported, federal law prevents removal. However, even "accurate" items may have:

•
Incorrect dates
•
Wrong amounts
•
Missing documentation
•
FCRA violations in reporting

That's what we look for and challenge.

See What's On Your Report
Picture Your Score at 720. See Yourself Getting Approved. Imagine Saving $15,000 in Interest.

Imagine checking your credit in 90 days—watching those negative items disappear. Getting that car loan at 4% instead of 18%. Qualifying for the mortgage you've been dreaming about. Refinancing debt and pocketing thousands in savings. That financial freedom you deserve is one decision away.

Common Questions About Credit Repair

Get answers to common questions about our credit repair service.

How long does credit repair take?

First results typically appear in 30-45 days after bureaus respond to initial disputes. Significant improvements (50-100 point increases) usually take 3-6 months. Complex cases with many negative items may require 6-12 months for maximum results. We provide realistic timelines during your free analysis.

Is credit repair legal?

Yes. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) gives you the legal right to dispute inaccurate, unverifiable, or unfair information on your credit reports. Credit repair companies simply exercise these rights more effectively than most consumers can alone. We're fully compliant with CROA, TSR, and California CSO regulations.

What negative items can you remove?

We can challenge any item that is inaccurate, unverifiable, or unfairly reported—including late payments, collections, charge-offs, repossessions, foreclosures, bankruptcies, judgments, tax liens, and unauthorized hard inquiries. However, we CANNOT remove accurate, verifiable negative items. Even 'accurate' items often contain errors (wrong dates, amounts, missing documentation) that make them removable.

How much will my score improve?

Average clients see 60-110 point increases over 6 months. Some with multiple removable items gain 150+ points. However, improvement depends on your starting score, credit history, and how many negative items are successfully removed. We provide realistic expectations during your consultation—no false promises.

Why can't I just dispute online with the bureaus myself?

You legally can—and some people succeed. But DIY has major drawbacks: (1) Takes 10-15 hours/month, (2) Generic disputes are easily rejected, (3) You need expertise in FCRA violations, Metro 2 compliance, debt validation, (4) No creditor relationships for negotiations, (5) One mistake can hurt your case. Professional service saves time and increases success rates significantly.

Why can't I talk to someone before signing up?

Due to FTC Telemarketing Sales Rules (TSR) for credit repair, we legally cannot do phone consultations until you've signed an agreement and provided payment details. This protects consumers from high-pressure sales tactics. However, you CAN: (1) Use our live chat for questions, (2) Review our free credit analysis online, (3) Read all terms before committing. Once you're a client, phone support is available.

What if the bureaus verify the account I'm disputing?

If a bureau verifies an item on the first attempt, we don't give up. We try alternative strategies: (1) Direct creditor negotiation, (2) Goodwill letters for accurate-but-old items, (3) Debt validation requests to collectors, (4) FCRA violation identification, (5) Re-dispute with additional documentation. Multiple dispute rounds often succeed even after initial verification.

Why We Can't Offer Phone Consultations (Yet)

You might notice we can't talk on the phone until you sign up. This isn't because we're hiding anything—it's federal law.

The FTC's Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) prohibits credit repair companies from doing phone or live consultations before a signed agreement. This rule exists to protect consumers from high-pressure sales tactics.

Here's what this means for you:

You can ask questions via live chat anytime
You can review your free credit analysis online
You can see all pricing and terms upfront
You have a 3-day right to cancel after signing
Once you're a client, phone support is available

If another credit company offers phone consultations BEFORE you sign up, that's a major red flag—they're breaking federal law.

Featured in local and national media for our proven Mesa360 Credit System™

We Know You've Been Promised Quick Fixes Before.

You've probably seen ads promising to "erase bad credit in 30 days" or "guaranteed 100-point increases." Here's the truth: those promises are not only unrealistic—they may violate federal law.

Bad credit doesn't define you.

It's just a chapter in your financial story. And with the right strategy, it's a chapter you can rewrite.

Maybe you're stuck in the cycle:

Denied for mortgages, car loans, or credit cards because of your score
Stuck paying sky-high interest rates that cost you thousands extra
Collections calls and letters that won't stop
Feeling overwhelmed by the dispute process
Tried DIY dispute letters with no results
Burned by "credit restoration" companies that disappeared with your money

Sound familiar? You're not alone—and there's a proven path forward.

That's where Mesa Group's Mesa360 Credit System™ comes in.

The Mesa360 Credit System™: Your Complete Financial Transformation Blueprint

Here's what makes us different: We don't just erase bad marks and disappear. We walk beside you through the entire journey—from breaking free of the mistakes holding you back, to building the financial foundation that changes everything, to positioning you for opportunities you thought were out of reach.

This isn't a service. It's a partnership. It's a transformation. It's your second chance, done right.

PHASE 1
BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS

What's Really Holding You Back

Before we can move forward, we need to understand what's anchoring you to the past. Not just the obvious stuff—but the hidden damage, the errors, the items that shouldn't even be there.

Deep Credit Forensics

We pull your credit from all three bureaus—Experian, Equifax, TransUnion—and perform a forensic analysis. Not a 5-minute glance. A real investigation.

What We're Looking For:

• Collections that aren't yours or can't be verified
• Late payments reported incorrectly (wrong dates, wrong amounts)
• Charge-offs missing required documentation
• Bankruptcies that should have aged off years ago
• Inquiries you never authorized
• Accounts reporting wrong balances or fabricated payment history
• Identity theft red flags hiding in plain sight

The Truth Moment:

Most people discover 3-7 items on their report that are either completely inaccurate or can't be legally verified. You're not asking for favors. You're demanding accuracy. That's your right under federal law.

What You Get:

• Free 3-Bureau Credit Analysis (normally $50+ value)
• Written breakdown of every negative item—and whether it's disputable
• Honest assessment of your timeline and what's realistic
• Custom dispute strategy built for YOUR situation, not a template
PHASE 2
REPAIR WHAT'S BROKEN

Removing the Weight You've Been Carrying

Now the real work begins. We don't send generic letters. We don't use offshore call centers. We don't "set it and forget it."

Your dedicated account manager—a real person who knows your name, your story, your goals—builds a custom dispute strategy based on FCRA/FDCPA law, your unique credit profile, and the specific violations we found.

Our Arsenal of Advanced Methods:

Direct Digital Uploads to all 3 bureaus (faster than mail, harder to ignore)
Experian Rapid Inquiry Removal (proprietary access most companies don't have)
Direct Creditor & Collector Disputes (going straight to the source)
CFPB Complaints (when bureaus stonewall you, we escalate to federal oversight)
Metro 2 Challenges (advanced formatting disputes for complex items)
Legal Team Escalation (when they violate FCRA, we bring in the attorneys)

We Handle Everything:

• All communication with bureaus and creditors
• All follow-ups, re-disputes, escalations
• All documentation, tracking, and compliance
• Every 35 days, you get a detailed progress update in your client portal

You don't lift a finger. You just watch the progress.

PHASE 3
BUILD YOUR NEW FOUNDATION

Learning to Win Long-Term

Here's where most credit repair companies fail you: they remove the bad stuff, take your money, and ghost you. Then 6 months later, you're back where you started because nobody taught you how to actually BUILD credit.

Not here. Not with Mesa360.

1-on-1 Financial Coaching (Included in Every Plan)

Your account manager doesn't just file disputes. They teach you the game.

You'll Master:

• Credit Utilization Mastery – How to use cards without hurting your score (it's not just "keep it under 30%")
• Strategic Application Timing – When to apply for new credit and when to WAIT
• Positive Payment History Building – Building good credit while we remove the bad
• Credit Mix Strategy – Understanding why account diversity matters (and how to build it safely)
• Long-Term Protection – Avoiding the traps that got you here in the first place

Monthly Strategy Calls:

Every 35 days, you're not just getting a "here's what got deleted" email. You're getting on the phone with your account manager to:

• Review what changed (and why)
• Adjust strategy based on results
• Answer questions about next steps
• Plan for major financial moves (buying a car, applying for a mortgage, etc.)

Customized Action Plan:

No cookie-cutter templates. No "here's what we tell everyone." Your roadmap is built for YOUR goals:

• Trying to buy a house in 6 months? We structure around that.
• Need business funding? We position you for that.
• Just want financial peace? We focus on stability.
PHASE 4
OPTIMIZE FOR MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY

Positioning You to Win

We don't just repair your credit. We optimize your entire financial profile so when opportunity knocks, you're ready to answer.

Funding Profile Optimization

We help you understand:

• How lenders actually evaluate your profile (it's more than just your score)
• Which accounts to open (and which to avoid)
• How to position yourself for maximum approval odds
• When to apply for mortgages, business funding, loans
• How to leverage good credit for wealth building

Strategic Credit Building

Learn which tradelines add value, which hurt you, and how to build strategically—not randomly.

Exit Strategy & Life After Restoration

When you graduate from our program, you don't just leave with a better score. You leave with:

• Complete understanding of how to maintain it
• Knowledge of when to refinance high-interest debt
• A plan to leverage your improved credit for financial growth
• Confidence that you'll never need credit repair again
WHY THE MESA360 CREDIT SYSTEM™ ACTUALLY WORKS

It's Comprehensive

We don't just dispute items. We educate you, support you, and coach you through total financial transformation.

It's Personalized

Your credit situation is unique. Your strategy should be too. No generic templates. No one-size-fits-all.

It's Proven

• 2,500+ clients nationwide
• 150+ five-star reviews
• 83-point average score increase
• Real results you can verify

It's Legal

We follow FCRA/FDCPA regulations to the letter. No shady tactics. No gray areas. No putting you at risk.

It's Backed by Real Legal Power

When creditors or bureaus violate your rights, we don't back down. We escalate to our legal team—real attorneys who've recovered thousands in settlements for clients whose rights were violated.

Important: Legitimate credit restoration takes time. While we cannot guarantee specific results, most clients see measurable improvements within 45-90 days. Individual timelines vary based on the complexity of your credit situation and credit bureau responsiveness. The bureaus have 30 days to investigate each dispute, and most items require 1-2 dispute cycles to resolve.

REALISTIC TIMELINE & EXPECTATIONS
The Truth About Credit Restoration:

Anyone promising "30-day miracles" or "guaranteed 100-point increases" is lying to you—and possibly breaking federal law.

If we don't deliver results in 90 days, you get 100% of your money back

No false promises. Just real work. And real results.

Vague "satisfaction" promises with impossible-to-navigate refund processes. Good luck getting your money back.	N/A (you already wasted time you can't get back).
WHAT THIS REALLY MEANS FOR YOU
🎯
Mesa Group = Partnership

You're not just hiring a service. You're gaining a partner, a coach, a dedicated team that succeeds when YOU succeed.

🏢
Typical Companies = Transaction

They want your money. They don't care about your transformation. Send letters, collect fees, move on to the next customer.

📄
DIY = Isolation

You're alone, confused, and likely making mistakes that could make things worse.

WHEN LEGAL ESCALATION HAPPENS

Your Rights Are Protected By Federal Law—And We Make Sure They're Enforced

While Mesa Group Consulting is not a law firm, we work with licensed attorneys who specialize in consumer protection and FCRA violations.

When We Bring in the Legal Team:
🚨
Bureau Fails to Investigate Within 30 Days

Federal law requires a response within 30 days. If they ignore you, we escalate to legal.

🚨
Creditor Re-Reports Deleted Information Without Verification

Once an item is removed, they can't just put it back without proper proof. If they do, that's a violation.

🚨
Collector Contacts You After Cease & Desist

Under FDCPA, once you tell them to stop, they must stop. Violations = potential damages.

🚨
Bureau Reports Inaccurate Info After You've Provided Proof of Error

Ignoring documented proof of inaccuracy is a violation of your FCRA rights.

🚨
Any Other Violation of Federal Consumer Protection Laws

We don't tolerate violations. Period.

What Legal Escalation Looks Like:

Paralegal FCRA/FDCPA Audits of your entire case

Attorney Review of violations and potential claims

Legal Demand Letters sent to creditors and bureaus

Settlement Negotiation Support when violations are clear

Documentation for Potential Litigation if needed

Real Financial Impact:

Many qualified clients have received cash settlements ranging from $1,000 to $2,500+ when creditors or bureaus violated their rights—in addition to removal of inaccurate items.

The Bottom Line:

We don't make promises we can't keep. We make progress you can measure. And when your rights are violated, we fight back with real legal power.

This Isn't Just Credit Restoration. It's a Complete Financial Transformation.

Most credit recovery companies send generic dispute letters and disappear. At Mesa Group, every client gets a dedicated account manager, customized action plan, monthly reviews, and 1-on-1 financial coaching.

Customized Action Plan

Your account manager creates a personalized roadmap based on YOUR unique credit situation—not a one-size-fits-all template.

Dedicated Account Manager

A real person assigned to your case who knows your name, your story, and your goals. No random reps each time.

Monthly Progress Reviews

Every 35 days: what was disputed, what was removed, what's in progress, and your next steps. We walk you through everything.

Credit Building Education

Learn how utilization works, when to apply for credit, building payment history, and protecting your credit long-term.

Ongoing Support

Questions answered throughout the process. Guidance on major decisions like buying a car or applying for a mortgage.

Why This Matters

Removing items is half the battle. Without learning to build good credit, you'll end up back where you started.

"I came to Mesa Group with a 540 score and collections I didn't understand. My account manager, Maria, didn't just file disputes—she explained every step, taught me how credit utilization works, and helped me build a plan to keep my score high after the program. Nine months later, I'm at 710 and I finally understand how to manage my credit."

— Carlos R., Bakersfield, CA

Days to First Results

"From 540 to 695 in 75 Days—I Finally Got My Dream Home"

"I was skeptical after being denied for a mortgage twice. I'd tried DIY dispute letters with no results. Within 75 days of working with Mesa Group, they removed 6 inaccurate collections and my score increased from 540 to 695. Last month, I closed on my dream home in Bakersfield."

— Sarah M., Bakersfield, CA

"100+ Point Increase in Under 4 Months"

"I came to Mesa Group in the low 500s. Great experience, great communication. Across all three bureaus, we're up over 100 points. I was able to get approved for a business loan I'd been denied for twice before. Believe in the process."

— Carlos R., Kern County, CA

"Tried DIY for 6 Months—Got Nowhere"

"I wasted 6 months trying to do it myself with templates from the internet. The bureaus ignored me. Mesa Group removed 3 items in the first 60 days—items I'd been fighting on my own for half a year. Wish I'd hired them sooner."

— David R., Bakersfield, CA

"Transparent Pricing, No Hidden Fees"

"I signed up for the monthly plan. Transparent pricing, no hidden fees. Canceled after 5 months when I hit my goal score (720). Exactly as advertised. No pressure to stay longer than I needed."

— Maria L., CA

WHY SMARTCREDIT IS REQUIRED
Real-Time 3-Bureau Monitoring

SmartCredit provides instant access to your credit reports from Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. We need this to:

See your actual credit reports to file accurate disputes
Track your progress in real-time (you see what we see)
Ensure both you and your account manager have the same information
Catch new items immediately

Cost: $1 for 7-day trial, then $27.99/month

Important: SmartCredit is a third-party service not owned by Mesa Group. You maintain direct control over your account.

Why This Matters:

Without real-time monitoring, we're flying blind. Disputes could be resolved and we wouldn't know. New items could appear and we'd miss them. SmartCredit keeps everyone aligned—and keeps you in control.

90 Days. Real Results. Or Every Dollar Back.

We don't just talk about results. We put it in writing with our legally backed 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee.

How It Works
You Hold Up Your End:
✓ Keep SmartCredit 3-Bureau monitoring active
✓ Stay responsive to your account manager
✓ Keep your account current
✓ Avoid adding new late payments during the 90 days
✓ Follow your account manager's guidance
We Deliver Results:
✓ Remove at least 1 verifiable negative item within 90 days
✓ Provide monthly progress reports and portal access
✓ Work your file with advanced dispute methods
✓ Escalate violations to our legal team when needed

If We Don't Deliver:

You get 100% of your money back. Every dollar you paid to Mesa Group.

Why We Can Offer This

Because we're that confident in the Mesa360 Credit System™.

Most clients see results in the first 30-45 days. We use advanced dispute methods, not cookie-cutter templates. Your dedicated account manager works your file personally. Our reputation depends on your success.

✨ This is The Mesa360 Guarantee.
Real Results in 90 Days — or Your Money Back.

What's Not Covered by the Mesa 360 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee

Transparency is important to us. Here's what the Mesa 360 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee does NOT cover:

SmartCredit Monitoring Fees

The $27.99/month SmartCredit subscription is a separate third-party service and is not refundable through Mesa Group. SmartCredit has its own cancellation policy.

Cases Where Client Responsibilities Aren't Met

To qualify for the guarantee, you must:

•
Keep your SmartCredit monitoring active for the full 90 days (no 30+ day gaps)
•
Respond to your account manager's communications (no 30+ days of silence)
•
Keep your Mesa account current (no invoices 30+ days past due)
•
Avoid adding new negative items during the first 90 days (new late payments, collections, charge-offs)
•
Avoid multiple new hard inquiries during the initial dispute period
•
Follow guidance provided by your account manager
New Negatives Added During Service

If you add new late payments, new collections, or other new negative items after enrollment, those items are not covered by the removal guarantee. The guarantee applies to items on your report at the time of enrollment.

Accurate, Timely, and Verifiable Information

Federal law (CROA) prohibits us from guaranteeing the removal of accurate information. If bureaus and creditors properly verify that negative items are accurate, complete, and timely, those items may remain on your report despite our best efforts. We can only legally dispute items that are inaccurate, incomplete, unverifiable, or outdated.

Ruby & Emerald (Prepaid Annual Plans) After 90 Days

The 90-day money-back guarantee is your primary protection for annual plans. After 90 days, refunds are evaluated case-by-case based on work completed, as these are prepaid programs.

Risk-Free Credit Restoration: You've Got Nothing to Lose
3-Day Cancellation Right (All Plans)

Federal law (CROA) requires that we honor a 3-day cancellation period. If you enroll in Mesa 360 and change your mind for ANY reason within the first 3 days, you can cancel and receive a 100% refund of all Mesa fees paid. No questions asked.

90-Day Money-Back Guarantee (When You Meet Your Part)

If you follow all client responsibilities for the first 90 days and we don't remove at least one negative item from your credit report, you get 100% of your money back. Every dollar you paid to Mesa Group.

Monthly Plans: Cancel Anytime After 90 Days

For monthly Mesa 360 plans (Lite, Flex, Elite), you can cancel at any time after the initial 90 days with no penalties or future charges. You only pay for work already completed.

Why This Guarantee Matters

Most credit restoration companies don't offer this level of protection. We can make this guarantee because:

•
We have a 91% success rate in removing or correcting negative items
•
Our Mesa 360 system uses proven legal strategies, not generic template letters
•
Our partnered legal team backs up our disputes when violations occur
•
We've helped thousands of clients improve their credit scores (average 150-point increase)

The only way you don't see results is if you don't hold up your end—keeping monitoring active, staying responsive, and avoiding new negatives.

If you do your part, we deliver results or refund your investment.

Your Questions, Answered.

We believe in transparency. Here are honest answers to the questions most people ask before starting their credit restoration journey.

THE BIG 5 QUESTIONS
1. Is this legit or a scam?

Absolutely legitimate. Mesa Group Consulting is a CROA-compliant financial services company operating in full accordance with federal consumer protection laws. We're not a fly-by-night operation—we're a real business with:

A physical office in Bakersfield, CA that you can visit
2,500+ clients served nationwide
150+ five-star reviews from real customers
Featured in local media (KGET17, Studio17, Telemundo, The CW)
Full legal team for FCRA violation cases
Transparent pricing with no hidden fees

We're proud to serve clients in English, Spanish, and Punjabi (🇺🇸 🇪🇸 🇮🇳). You can call us, visit us, or read reviews from real people we've helped. We're as real as it gets.

2. Will this hurt my credit more?

No. Legitimate credit disputes filed under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) cannot hurt your credit score. In fact, it's your legal right to dispute inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information on your credit report.

Here's what happens when we dispute items:

Credit bureaus investigate the item (they have 30 days to respond)
If the item cannot be verified, it must be removed
If it's verified as accurate, it stays on your report
Your credit score is not penalized for disputing items

What CAN hurt your credit:

Continuing to miss payments on current accounts
Applying for too much new credit during the process
Closing old credit card accounts (reduces your credit age)

That's why our program includes 1-on-1 financial coaching—we teach you what to do AND what NOT to do while we're working on your disputes.

3. How much is this going to cost total?

We believe in transparent pricing. Here's exactly what you'll pay:

Monthly Plans:

Mesa360 Lite: $350 initial setup + $149/month (ongoing)
Mesa360 Flex: $500 initial setup + $199/month (ongoing)
Mesa360 Elite: $800 initial setup + $299/month (ongoing)

12-Month Programs (Pay in Full & Save):

Ruby Plan: $1,500 one-time payment (saves you $888 vs. monthly Flex)
Emerald Plan: $1,800 one-time payment (saves you $1,788 vs. monthly Elite)

What's included in every plan:

✅ Dedicated account manager
✅ 1-on-1 financial coaching
✅ Customized action plan
✅ Monthly progress reports
✅ Client portal + mobile app access
✅ Ongoing support (monthly plans) or 12 months of service (prepaid plans)

Additional requirement: You must maintain a SmartCredit 3-Bureau monitoring account ($27.99/month after $1 for 7-day trial) throughout the entire process. This gives us—and you—real-time access to your credit reports from all three bureaus.

No hidden fees. No upsells. No surprises.

You can cancel your monthly plan anytime (we have a 3-day risk-free cancellation window from signup). The 12-month programs are paid in full but can be financed through Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) options.

4. How long does it actually take to see results?

Most clients see their first results within 45-90 days. However, timelines vary based on several factors:

What affects your timeline:

Complexity of your credit situation: Someone with 3 collections will see results faster than someone with bankruptcies, repos, and charge-offs
Credit bureau responsiveness: Bureaus have 30 days to investigate disputes, but sometimes they respond sooner
Creditor cooperation: Some creditors respond quickly; others require multiple rounds of disputes
Ongoing credit behavior: If you're still missing payments or adding new negative items, progress will be slower

Realistic expectations:

First 30-45 days: Initial disputes filed, first bureau responses received
45-90 days: Most clients see first deletions and score improvements
90-180 days: Significant progress; multiple rounds of disputes completed
6-12 months: Most comprehensive results achieved

What we guarantee: We cannot guarantee specific score increases or exact timelines—any company that does is violating federal law (CROA). What we CAN promise is a legally compliant, persistent dispute process with measurable progress tracking every step of the way.

Important note on monthly plans: Our monthly plans (Lite/Flex/Elite) provide ongoing support. If you add new items during the process, we'll work on them. This is different from our 12-month programs, which focus only on your credit profile at the time of enrollment.

5. Can I do this myself instead of paying someone?

Yes—and we'll be the first to tell you that you have every legal right to dispute items yourself for free.

But here's the reality:

Why DIY often fails:

Credit bureaus recognize generic templates: If you're using dispute letter templates from the internet, so are thousands of other people. Bureaus know these templates and often reject them automatically.
It's time-consuming: You'll spend hours researching laws, tracking responses, following up with multiple bureaus, and managing documentation.
It's confusing: Understanding FCRA, FDCPA, Metro 2 reporting, and creditor verification processes requires specialized knowledge.
One mistake can hurt you: Saying the wrong thing in a dispute letter can actually hurt your case or give bureaus ammunition to verify inaccurate items.

What we bring to the table:

Personalized dispute strategies: No cookie-cutter templates—every letter is customized to your unique situation
Advanced methods: Digital uploads, Experian rapid inquiry removal, CFPB complaints, direct creditor disputes, Metro 2 challenges, and more
Full legal team for violations: When bureaus or creditors violate your FCRA rights, we escalate with attorney support. Qualified clients have received settlements of $1,000–$2,500 for violations.
Ongoing coaching: We don't just dispute items—we teach you how to build and maintain good credit long-term
It's our full-time job: While you're working, spending time with family, or running your business, we're managing your disputes

Think of it this way: You CAN change your own oil, fix your own plumbing, or file your own taxes. But most people hire professionals because the time, expertise, and peace of mind are worth it.

Still want to try DIY first? We respect that. Download our free credit dispute letter template and give it a shot. If it works, great! If not, we're here when you're ready for professional help.

ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT QUESTIONS
6. What items can be removed from my credit report?

We can dispute any item that is:

Inaccurate: Wrong account number, incorrect balance, belongs to someone else
Incomplete: Missing required information under FCRA guidelines
Outdated: Most negative items must be removed after 7 years (bankruptcies after 10 years)
Unverifiable: If the creditor cannot verify the debt or provide proper documentation

Common items we successfully dispute:

✅ Collections (medical, utility, credit card, etc.)
✅ Late payments
✅ Inquiries (hard pulls that weren't authorized)
✅ Charge-offs
✅ Bankruptcies (Chapter 7, Chapter 13)
✅ Repossessions
✅ Foreclosures
✅ Evictions
✅ Student loan defaults
✅ Identity theft accounts
✅ Accounts with inaccurate balances or payment history

What we CANNOT remove:

❌ Accurate, verifiable negative items (that would be illegal)
❌ Current bankruptcies still within the 7-10 year reporting period if properly documented
❌ Tax liens (these are public records)
❌ Court judgments that are accurate and within reporting period

Our approach: We follow consumer law, factual disputing principles, and FCRA/FDCPA regulations to help clients fix their credit ethically and legally. We don't promise to "erase" everything—we promise to challenge everything that's legally disputable and get results where creditors and bureaus can't verify their claims.

7. Do you have legal support for FCRA violations?

Yes. While Mesa Group Consulting is not a law firm, we have a full legal team available for cases where creditors or credit bureaus violate your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) or Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).

When legal escalation happens:

A bureau fails to investigate your dispute within 30 days
A creditor re-reports deleted information without proper verification
A collector contacts you after being told to cease communication
A bureau reports inaccurate information after you've provided proof of error
Any other violation of federal consumer protection laws

What legal support includes:

Paralegal FCRA/FDCPA audits of your case
Attorney review and escalation letters
Legal demand letters to creditors and bureaus
Support for potential violation claims

Settlements: Many qualified clients have received settlements ranging from $1,000 to $2,500 (or more) when creditors or bureaus are found in violation of federal law. These settlements are in addition to the removal of inaccurate items.

Important note: Not every case qualifies for legal escalation—violations must be clear and documented. Your account manager will identify potential violations during your dispute process and escalate when appropriate.

8. Do you work with all three credit bureaus?

Yes. We file disputes with all three major credit bureaus:

Experian
Equifax
TransUnion

Why all three matter: Different lenders report to different bureaus. Your score can vary significantly between bureaus depending on what's reported. For example:

Your mortgage lender might pull Equifax
Your auto lender might pull Experian
Your credit card company might pull TransUnion

That's why we dispute items across all three bureaus to ensure comprehensive coverage. When you apply for credit, you want clean reports everywhere.

How we access your reports: Through your SmartCredit 3-Bureau monitoring account, we (and you) get real-time access to your reports from all three bureaus. This allows us to:

See exactly what creditors are reporting
Track which disputes are successful
Identify new items that appear
Monitor your score changes in real-time
9. What happens if an item comes back 'verified'?

If a credit bureau verifies an item after our first dispute, that doesn't mean the process is over. Here's what happens next:

Round 2: Advanced Dispute Methods

We request the "method of verification" (MOV) from the bureau—they must tell us HOW they verified it
We review the creditor's documentation for errors or missing information
We file a second dispute with additional evidence or a different angle of challenge

Round 3: Direct Creditor Disputes

We bypass the bureau and go directly to the creditor/collector
We demand proof of the debt under FDCPA guidelines
We challenge reporting accuracy at the source

Round 4: CFPB Complaints

We file complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
This triggers a mandatory investigation and response from creditors/bureaus
Often results in deletions when companies realize they lack proper documentation

Round 5: Legal Review (If Applicable)

If we identify FCRA violations, we escalate to our legal team
Attorney escalation letters often result in removal to avoid legal liability

Persistence pays off: Many items that are initially "verified" are eventually removed on subsequent rounds. Why? Because:

Creditors often don't have complete documentation
Bureaus and creditors hope you'll give up after one attempt
Each dispute round forces them to re-verify—and they often can't

Client example: Sarah had a $4,200 medical collection verified twice. On the third dispute, we went directly to the collection agency and demanded documentation under FDCPA. They couldn't provide itemized medical records (HIPAA privacy protection), so they deleted it.

10. Can you guarantee my score will increase by X points?

No—and you should run from any company that makes that promise.

Under the Credit Repair Organizations Act (CROA), it is illegal for credit restoration companies to:

Guarantee specific score increases
Promise removal of accurate negative items
Charge upfront fees before work is performed (we comply with this through our $0 due today model with 3-day cancellation window)

What we CAN promise:

✅ A legally compliant, personalized dispute process
✅ Persistent challenges to inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable items
✅ Measurable progress tracking with monthly reports
✅ 1-on-1 coaching to build positive credit during the process
✅ Full legal team support for FCRA violations
✅ Transparency every step of the way

Why we can't guarantee specific results:

We don't control how creditors and bureaus respond
Your score depends on multiple factors (payment history, utilization, credit age, etc.)
Everyone's credit situation is unique

What we CAN show you: Real results from real clients:

Sarah: 540 → 695 in 75 days (6 collections removed)
Carlos: 520s → 100+ point increase in under 4 months
Maria: 580 → 710 in 9 months (included charge-offs and late payments)

Results may vary. Individual timelines and outcomes depend on the complexity of your credit situation.

11. What's included in the 1-on-1 financial coaching?

Every Mesa Group client—regardless of which plan you choose—gets a dedicated account manager and personalized financial coaching. This isn't just credit restoration; it's a complete financial transformation program.

Your coaching includes:

📊 Customized Action Plan

Review of your current credit situation
Identification of all disputable items
Strategy for building positive credit during the process
Timeline expectations based on your unique situation

👤 Dedicated Account Manager

Real person assigned to your case (no switching between random reps)
Direct phone and email access
Trilingual support available (🇺🇸 English | 🇪🇸 Español | 🇮🇳 Punjabi)
They know your name, your story, and your goals

📈 Monthly Progress Reviews

Detailed updates on dispute progress

Score change analysis

🎯 Credit Building Education

How to use credit cards responsibly (utilization ratios, payment timing)

Understanding credit mix and account age
Protecting your credit long-term

💡 Ongoing Support

Questions answered throughout the process
Guidance on major financial decisions (buying a car, applying for a mortgage)
Help understanding credit bureau responses
Support beyond just the disputes

Why coaching matters: Removing negative items is only half the battle. Without learning how to build and maintain good credit, you'll end up back where you started. Our clients don't just see score increases—they achieve lasting financial transformation.

"I came to Mesa Group with a 540 score and collections I didn't understand. My account manager, Maria, didn't just file disputes—she explained every step, taught me how credit utilization works, and helped me build a plan to keep my score high after the program. Nine months later, I'm at 710 and I finally understand how to manage my credit."

— Carlos R., Bakersfield, CA

12. What's the difference between your monthly plans and 12-month programs?

Great question—we offer both options to fit different needs and budgets.

MONTHLY PLANS (Lite, Flex, Elite) - BEST FOR FLEXIBILITY

Structure:

Initial setup fee ($350-$800 depending on plan)
Ongoing monthly fee ($149-$299 depending on plan)
Cancel anytime (after 3-day risk-free window)

Key Advantage: ✅ Ongoing support for new items—If you add new negative items during the process (like a late payment or new collection), we'll work on them. No additional charge.

Why this matters: Life happens. Despite our coaching and guidance, clients sometimes add new late payments or inquiries during the credit recovery process. Monthly plans keep you covered and accountable—we don't abandon your case when new challenges arise. This flexibility is worth the ongoing investment for clients with active or evolving credit situations.

Best for:

People who want maximum flexibility
Active credit situations (still working on paying down debts, applying for credit)
Those who prefer to pay as they go
Clients who want ongoing support as long as needed

12-MONTH PROGRAMS (Ruby, Emerald) - BEST FOR SAVINGS

Structure:

One-time payment ($1,500 for Ruby, $1,800 for Emerald)
Can be paid in full OR financed through Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)
Full 12 months of service

Key Advantage: ✅ Significant savings—Save $888 (Ruby) or $1,788 (Emerald) vs. paying monthly

Important Note: ❌ Comprehensive 12-month program focused on your current credit profile at enrollment. New items added during the program will NOT be worked on.

Best for:

People who want to save money upfront
Stable credit situations (no new negatives expected)
Clients committed to a full year of service
Those who prefer one-and-done payment

Which plan is right for you?

Choose Monthly Plans if:

You want flexibility to cancel anytime
Your credit situation is still evolving
You want support for new items as they appear
You prefer to pay as you go

Choose 12-Month Programs if:

You want to save money (up to $1,788)
Your credit situation is stable
You're committed to a full year
You prefer to pay once and be done

Still not sure? Book a free consultation, and we'll review your credit situation and recommend the best plan for your needs.

Not at all! While we're headquartered in Bakersfield, California, we serve clients nationwide.

How it works:

Everything is done remotely: Phone, email, and our client portal
No office visits required: We handle everything digitally
Same great service: Whether you're in California, Texas, Florida, or anywhere else in the U.S., you get the same dedicated account manager, 1-on-1 coaching, and personalized service

But if you ARE local:

✅ You're welcome to visit our Bakersfield office for in-person consultations
✅ We love meeting clients face-to-face when possible

Our Office:

📍 5001 California Ave Suite 219
Bakersfield, CA 93309
📞 (661) 310-3040
📧 contact@mesagroupconsulting.com

Trilingual support nationwide: Our English, Spanish, and Punjabi speaking team members (🇺🇸 🇪🇸 🇮🇳) work remotely with clients across the country.

14. How do I track my progress?

Transparency is one of our core values. You'll always know exactly what's happening with your credit.

You get access to:

📱 Mobile App

Track dispute progress in real-time
See which items are being worked on
View bureau responses as they come in
Check your score changes

💻 Client Portal (Desktop)

Full dashboard of all disputes
Document uploads and storage
Communication history with your account manager
Monthly progress reports

📊 Monthly Progress Reports

Detailed written updates every 35 days
What was disputed
What was removed
What's still in progress
Next steps

📧 Direct Communication

Email updates when important changes occur
Phone access to your dedicated account manager
Timely response to your questions and requests

🔍 SmartCredit 3-Bureau Monitoring

Real-time access to all three credit reports
Score tracking across all bureaus
Alerts when changes occur

You're never in the dark about what's happening with your credit.

15. What happens after my credit is restored?

Our goal isn't just to fix your credit—it's to transform your financial future. Here's what happens:

During the Program:

We remove inaccurate items
You learn credit building strategies through coaching
Your score improves steadily
You start getting approved for better credit products

After Major Items Are Removed:

Monthly plan clients: You can continue service as long as you want ongoing support, or you can cancel anytime
12-month program clients: You complete your full year of service with continued monitoring and coaching
We provide a "credit maintenance" guide with long-term strategies

Your next steps:

🏠 Apply for that mortgage you've been denied for
🚗 Get approved for a car loan with reasonable rates
💳 Access better credit cards with rewards and lower APRs
💼 Secure business funding if you're an entrepreneur
🎓 Refinance student loans at lower interest rates

Ongoing support (if needed):

Many clients stay with us on monthly plans even after major clean-up work is done because:

They want ongoing monitoring and coaching
They like having an account manager to call with questions
They continue applying for new accounts and want guidance
They want protection if new items appear

You're in control: There's no pressure to stay or leave. When you feel confident managing your credit independently, you're free to cancel (monthly plans) or you'll complete your 12-month term (prepaid plans) and graduate from the program.

Our success = your success: When you close on a house, buy your dream car, or secure that business loan, that's what it's all about. We're here to make that happen.

16. What is SmartCredit and why do I need it?

SmartCredit is a credit monitoring service that provides real-time access to your credit reports from all three bureaus (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion). It's a required tool for our program.

Why it's required:

📊 Real-Time Access

We need to see your actual credit reports to file accurate disputes
You get to track your progress in real-time
Both you and your account manager see the same information

🔍 3-Bureau Coverage

Most free credit monitoring (like Credit Karma) only shows Vantage Scores, which lenders don't use
SmartCredit shows FICO scores, which are what mortgage, auto, and credit card lenders actually pull
Covers all three bureaus, not just one or two

⚡ Updates Fast

When items are removed, you see it within days
Alerts you to new items or changes immediately
Critical for tracking dispute effectiveness

Cost:

$1 for 7-day trial
Then $27.99/month after trial ends
You must maintain this throughout your program

Why we don't include it in our price:

SmartCredit is a third-party service (not owned by Mesa Group)
You maintain direct control over your account
You can cancel SmartCredit separately if you leave our program

After your program:

Many clients choose to keep SmartCredit even after completing credit recovery because it's valuable for:

Ongoing monitoring
Identity theft protection
Tracking your continued credit building
17. Can I apply for new credit during the program?

Yes, but strategically.

This is one of the most important topics we cover in your 1-on-1 coaching, because applying for new credit during credit rebuilding can either help or hurt—depending on timing and approach.

General guidance:

✅ GOOD IDEAS:

Secured credit cards: These report positive payment history and help build credit with minimal risk
Credit builder loans: Specifically designed to help build credit
Becoming an authorized user: On someone else's account with good payment history
Applying for credit AFTER major removals: Once your score improves, your approval odds increase

❌ BAD IDEAS:

Applying for multiple cards at once: Hard inquiries can temporarily lower your score
Applying right before buying a house/car: Lenders want stable credit for 6+ months before major purchases
Opening store credit cards impulsively: Just because you get approved doesn't mean you should say yes
Taking on debt you can't afford: New credit is only helpful if you manage it responsibly

Our approach: Your account manager will create a personalized credit building strategy that includes:

When to apply for new credit (timing matters)
What types of credit to apply for
How to keep utilization low on new accounts
Building positive payment history while we remove negative items

Example strategy:

Months 1-2: Focus on disputes only; avoid new applications
Month 3: Apply for secured credit card after first removals boost your score
Months 4-6: Use secured card responsibly (under 10% utilization, pay in full monthly)
Month 6+: Consider additional credit building based on your goals

Monthly plan advantage: If you're on a monthly plan with ongoing support for new items, we'll work on any new inquiries or accounts that appear during the process.

Bottom line: Yes, you can apply for credit—but let's be strategic about it. That's what the coaching is for.

18. What's your refund policy?

90 Days. Real Results. Or You Get Every Dollar Back.

We don't just talk about results—we put it in writing.

Every Mesa Group client is protected by The Mesa360 Guarantee: a legally written, contract-backed 90-Day Money-Back Promise that most credit service companies aren't confident enough to offer.

Here's how it works:

If you hold up your end of the agreement and we don't deliver real, verifiable progress within the first 90 days, you get 100% of your money back. No excuses. No runaround. No fine print.

Your Responsibilities (What "Holding Up Your End" Means):

To qualify for the guarantee, you must:

✅ Keep SmartCredit Active: Maintain your 3-bureau monitoring throughout the 90 days (we need real-time access to your reports to work effectively). If your SmartCredit account is inactive for more than 30 days, you become ineligible for the guarantee.
✅ Stay Responsive: Respond to your account manager's requests for information or documentation. If you become unresponsive for more than 30 days, we can no longer service your account and the guarantee becomes void.
✅ Keep Your Account Current: Maintain payment on your Mesa Group account. Unpaid invoices for more than 30 days result in service suspension and guarantee ineligibility.
✅ Avoid New Negative Items: Don't add new late payments, collections, or charge-offs during the 90-day period (new negatives work against the progress we're making)
✅ Avoid New Hard Inquiries: Don't apply for multiple new credit accounts during the initial dispute period (this can temporarily lower your score and complicate the process)
✅ Follow Your Account Manager's Guidance: Your 1-on-1 coaching includes strategic advice—following it matters

Our Guarantee:

If you meet all those conditions and we don't remove at least 1 verifiable negative item from your credit report within 90 days, you qualify for a full refund of all fees paid to Mesa Group.

Important clarification:

"Results" means documented removal of at least 1 inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable item
We cannot guarantee specific score increases (that would violate CROA regulations)
Most clients see multiple removals within 90 days—this is a conservative baseline

Why We Can Offer This:

Most of our clients start seeing results in the first 30-45 days. Why? Because we work your file like our reputation depends on it—because it does.

Your case doesn't sit in a queue collecting dust
Your dedicated account manager is personally invested in your success
We use advanced dispute methods, not cookie-cutter templates
When violations occur, our legal team escalates

We're that confident in our process.

19. What are the cancellation terms and guarantee exclusions?

What's NOT Covered by the Guarantee:

❌ SmartCredit subscription fees (that's a third-party service you control)
❌ Inactive SmartCredit account (if your CMS is inactive for more than 30 days, we can't work on your case)
❌ Unpaid invoices (if your Mesa Group account has unpaid invoices for more than 30 days, service is suspended)
❌ Unresponsive clients (if you don't respond to communications for more than 30 days, we can no longer service your account)
❌ New negative items you add during the process (late payments, collections, inquiries)

3-Day Risk-Free Cancellation Window (All Plans):

In addition to the 90-Day Guarantee, you also get:

3-day cancellation window from signup date
Full refund if you cancel within 3 days for any reason
No questions asked, no hassle

After the 90-Day Period:

Monthly Plans (Lite, Flex, Elite):

You can cancel anytime after the 90-day guarantee period
No refund on work already completed, but no further charges
No cancellation fees or penalties

12-Month Programs (Ruby, Emerald):

Refunds after the 90-day guarantee window are evaluated case-by-case based on work completed
These are prepaid programs, so the 90-day guarantee is your primary protection

You've Got Nothing to Lose. Everything to Gain.

If you're serious about transforming your credit and your financial future, we'll match your commitment with everything we've got.

✨ This is The Mesa360 Guarantee.
Real Results in 90 Days — or Your Money Back.

20. Will you help me with identity theft?

Yes, absolutely.

Identity theft accounts (fraudulent accounts opened in your name) are some of the most damaging items that can appear on your credit report—and they're 100% disputable since they're not your responsibility.

What we do:

🚨 Identify Fraudulent Accounts

Review your credit report for accounts you don't recognize
Look for addresses you've never lived at
Spot inquiries you didn't authorize
Find patterns consistent with identity theft

📋 File Identity Theft Reports

Guide you through filing a report with the FTC (IdentityTheft.gov)
Help you file a police report (required for many disputes)
Document everything for credit bureau disputes

💼 Dispute Fraudulent Accounts

File disputes with all three bureaus
Submit identity theft affidavits
Provide police reports and FTC documentation
Escalate to legal team if bureaus don't comply

🛡️ Protect Your Credit Going Forward

Set up fraud alerts on your credit reports
Guide you through credit freezes (if appropriate)
Monitor for new fraudulent activity through SmartCredit

Important distinction:

Identity theft disputes: These are typically resolved faster because you have documentation proving fraud
Regular disputes: These challenge inaccurate or unverifiable items that may be yours but were misreported

Client example: Juan discovered 4 credit cards on his report that he never opened, totaling $18,000 in fraudulent charges. We helped him file FTC and police reports, disputed all four accounts, and had them removed within 60 days. His score jumped 127 points.

If you suspect identity theft, tell your account manager immediately.

21. Can you help with student loans?

Yes—but it depends on the situation.

Student loans are one of the most complex credit issues we handle. Here's what we can and can't do:

✅ WHAT WE CAN DISPUTE:

Inaccurate Reporting:

Late payments that you actually made on time
Incorrect balances or loan amounts
Loans showing as in default when they're current
Duplicate reporting of the same loan
Loans that don't belong to you

Federal Student Loan Rehabilitations:

If you've completed a loan rehabilitation program, the default should be removed from your credit report
We can dispute if it's still showing after successful rehabilitation

Private Student Loan Issues:

Unverifiable private student loans
Statute of limitations issues on very old private loans
Identity theft related to student loans

Older Student Loan Defaults:

Student loans in default that are older than 7 years should be removed
We can dispute these for deletion

Elite Plan Specific:

Our Mesa360 Elite plan specifically covers student loans with advanced dispute strategies

❌ WHAT WE CANNOT DO:

Remove Accurate, Current Student Loans:

If your student loans are accurately reported and you're responsible for them, they stay on your report
This applies to both federal and private student loans

Forgive or Reduce Your Student Loan Debt:

We don't negotiate student loan settlements or forgiveness
We're credit restoration experts, not student loan debt negotiators

What we CAN help with:

📚 Education and Guidance:

Explain your student loan repayment options (IBR, PAYE, REPAYE, etc.)
Direct you to resources for federal loan forgiveness programs
Help you understand deferment and forbearance impacts on credit

💡 Strategic Advice:

When to dispute vs. when to rehabilitate
How student loans affect your overall credit strategy
Building credit while managing student loans

🎯 Optimization:

If you're on an Elite plan, we include "funding profile optimization" which considers your entire financial picture, including student loans

Bottom line:

Inaccurate student loan reporting: We can fix that
Old defaulted student loans: We can dispute for removal
Accurate current student loans: These stay, but we help you manage their credit impact

If student loans are your main concern, mention that when booking your consultation so we can assess your specific situation.

What Can You Dispute?

•
Incorrect dates or balances
•
Missing required documentation
•
Reporting violations (Metro 2 errors)

Common Questions About DIY Credit Repair

Get answers to common questions about our DIY credit repair software.

Do I need to be tech-savvy to use this?

No. If you can use email and browse websites, you can use our software. We walk you through every step with video tutorials, tooltips, and simple instructions. Most people complete their first dispute letter in under 15 minutes.

How much time will this take per month?

Plan on 2-3 hours per month. Initial setup (importing reports, reviewing items) takes about 2 hours. After that, it's 30-60 minutes monthly to send disputes, track responses, and update your reports. Compare this to full-service credit repair which takes 0 hours but costs $149-449/month.

What's the difference between this and free DIY credit repair?

Free DIY means writing your own letters from scratch, creating Excel spreadsheets to track everything, and figuring out strategy yourself. Our software gives you AI-powered recommendations, professional letter templates, 3-bureau tracking, deadline management, and education—everything credit repair companies use. You save hundreds while getting professional tools.

Can I really dispute as many items as I want?

Yes. Whether you have 1 negative item or 50, the price is the same. Dispute all of them, re-dispute verified items with different strategies, send multiple rounds—unlimited. This is why DIY saves so much money compared to services that charge per-item or per-dispute.

What if I get stuck or have questions?

We provide email support from real credit repair experts. Typically respond within 24 hours on business days. Plus, our education library has tutorials, sample disputes, and step-by-step guides for common situations. You're never truly on your own.

Will bureaus take my disputes seriously?

Yes, IF you use proper dispute letters. That's exactly what our letter generator creates—professional, legally-compliant disputes that cite specific FCRA violations, Metro 2 errors, and debt validation requirements. Bureaus are REQUIRED by federal law to investigate all disputes, whether they come from you or a credit repair company.

How long until I see results?

Bureaus have 30 days to respond to disputes. Most people see their first deletions within 45-60 days. Significant score improvements (50+ points) typically happen within 3-6 months as multiple items are removed. Timeline depends on how many items you're disputing and how quickly bureaus respond.

Credit Is About Relationships, Not Just Numbers

Most people think credit is just about hitting a score. They obsess over three digits, constantly refreshing their credit apps, hoping their number magically jumps high enough to qualify for something.

That's the wrong approach.

Credit isn't a game you hack. It's a relationship system between you and financial institutions. Banks, credit unions, and lenders want to see one thing: Are you someone they can trust with their money?

And trust isn't built overnight. It's built through:

Consistency

Showing up every month with on-time payments

Responsibility

Managing different types of credit without maxing out

History

Demonstrating you've been reliable over time

Diversity

Proving you can handle both revolving credit and installment loans

"You can have a 750 credit score and still get denied. Someone with a 680 and relationships gets approved. This is the power of relationships."

You Can't Get Credit Without Credit History

It's the ultimate catch-22.

You walk into a car dealership. You've never missed a payment in your life. You have $5,000 saved for a down payment. You've been at your job for 3 years.

The salesperson runs your credit.

"I'm sorry, we can't approve you today. Your credit file is too thin."

Because lenders don't just want a clean report. They want to see proof that you can handle credit responsibly. And if you've never had credit—or if you recently removed all your negative accounts—you're essentially invisible to them.

Scenario 1: The Thin File Problem

You have maybe one credit card you opened a year ago. You pay it on time every month. But when you apply for a car loan, you get denied—not because of bad behavior, but because lenders can't see enough history to trust you.

Scenario 2: The "Clean Slate" Problem

You just finished credit restoration. All the negatives are gone. Your report is clean. But clean isn't fundable. With no positive accounts reporting, you're essentially starting from scratch.

Scenario 3: The "New Credit" Problem

You opened 3 credit cards last month hoping to build credit fast. Instead, your score dropped 40 points. Too many hard inquiries. No account age. Lenders now see you as risky.

Same Starting Point. Different Strategy. Completely Different Outcome.
Person A (Didn't Follow This Guide)
Opens 5 random credit cards in one month
Score drops 60 points from hard inquiries
Gets denied for an apartment because of "too many recent accounts"
Maxes out 2 cards trying to build utilization
Closes old accounts because "they're not using them"
12 months later: 580 score, no lending relationships, frustration
Person B (Followed This Guide)
Starts with 1 credit union secured card + 1 credit builder loan
Opens accounts strategically, 60+ days apart
Keeps utilization under 10% on every account
Adds rent reporting to backdate 24 months of payment history
After 6 months, adds 2 more revolving accounts strategically
12 months later: 720+ score, credit union relationship, auto loan pre-approval, $15K available credit

The difference? Person B understood that credit building isn't about finding a magic product. It's about strategic relationships and timing.

You're about to become Person B.

Credit Building = Adding Positive Accounts That Lenders Actually Want to See

Credit building means strategically opening accounts that report positive payment history to the credit bureaus. These accounts create the "credit depth" that lenders need to see before approving you for major purchases.

Pillar 1
Credit Union Relationships

Credit unions are member-owned, which means they're designed to help you succeed—not just profit from fees. When you open a secured card or credit builder account at a credit union, you're building a relationship that leads to future auto loans, personal loans, and eventually mortgages.

The Goal: Establish at least one credit union membership with an active account.

Pillar 2
Revolving Credit

These are credit cards and lines of credit where you can borrow, repay, and borrow again. Lenders want to see that you can manage available credit responsibly without maxing it out.

The Goal: 3-5 revolving accounts with combined credit limits of $10,000+ and utilization under 10%.

Pillar 3
Installment Credit

These are fixed loans with set payment amounts over time—like auto loans, mortgages, or credit builder loans. Having installment credit shows lenders you can commit to regular payments.

The Goal: 1-2 installment accounts showing consistent on-time payments.

Pillar 4
Account Age & Payment History

The longer your accounts have been open with positive payment history, the more trustworthy you appear. This is why closing old accounts or opening too many new ones can hurt you.

The Goal: Average account age of 2+ years with zero late payments.

Pillar 5
Credit Mix & Diversity

Lenders like seeing that you can manage different types of credit. Having only credit cards or only loans limits what they can assess about your financial responsibility.

The Goal: A mix of revolving and installment accounts demonstrating financial versatility.

Your Credit Building Journey in 3 Steps
1
Choose Your Tools

Based on your starting point, select the credit building accounts that make sense. Not everyone needs the same combination. Someone with zero credit history needs different tools than someone who just finished credit restoration.

Pick 3-5 accounts across different categories:

2-3 revolving accounts (credit builders or secured cards)
1-2 installment accounts (credit builder loans)
1 rent reporting service (optional but recommended)

We help you choose the right combination for your situation.

2
Open Accounts Strategically

Timing matters. Opening too many accounts at once triggers hard inquiries and signals desperation to lenders. The 60-Day Rule: Space new account applications at least 60 days apart to minimize score impact and avoid triggering "too many recent accounts" flags.

Timeline:

Month 1: Foundation accounts
Month 3-4: Secondary accounts
Month 6+: Strategic additions
3
Make On-Time Payments & Watch Your Profile Grow

Every on-time payment builds trust. Every month of responsible behavior strengthens your file. This isn't a hack—it's a system. And systems work when you work them consistently.

Results:

Credit score increases
Credit limits increase
Interest rates decrease
Approval odds increase

Real Results from Real People

"I went from no credit to a 738 score in 8 months. The strategy was simple—I just needed someone to show me the right order to do things."

Jessica M.

Bakersfield, CA

0 → 738 in 8 months

"After my credit restoration, I thought I was done. Mesa Group showed me that removing negatives was just step one. Building positive accounts is where the magic happens."

Marcus T.

Los Angeles, CA

540 → 712 in 10 months

"The rent reporting alone added 24 months of payment history I didn't know I could use. Game changer."

Sarah K.

Fresno, CA

580 → 695 in 6 months

"Person A vs. Person B? I was Person A for years. Once I followed this strategy, everything changed. Pre-approved for my first home loan last month."

David R.

Bakersfield, CA

620 → 745 in 12 months

Compliance Disclaimer: Results vary based on individual circumstances. Testimonials reflect individual experiences and are not a guarantee of similar outcomes.

Beyond the Score: Building Institutional Relationships

You can have a 750 credit score and still get denied for a mortgage. Why? Because the lender has never seen your name before. You have no relationship with them. No history. No trust.

But someone with a 680 who's been banking at the same credit union for 5 years, paid off a car loan through them, and has a checking account? They're getting approved—often with better terms.

"Credit scores are just the entry ticket. Relationships are what get you approved."

Your 5-Year Credit Journey
Year 1
Foundation Set

Credit union relationship established, 3-5 tradelines, 700+ score potential

Year 3
Relationship Growth

Auto loan paid/paying, personal loan access, $20K+ available credit

Year 5
Premium Access

Mortgage approved with competitive rates, $50K+ credit access, business funding opportunities

5 Mistakes That Cost People Months of Progress
Mistake #1: Opening Too Many Accounts at Once

Why It Hurts: Each application creates a hard inquiry. Multiple inquiries in a short period signals desperation to lenders and drops your score. "Too many recent accounts" is a common denial reason.

The Fix: Space applications 60+ days apart. Start with 1-2 accounts and build gradually.

Mistake #2: Skipping the Credit Union

Why It Hurts: Banks and credit card companies don't build relationships—they build profits. Credit unions are designed to help members succeed and will approve you for future loans based on your membership history.

The Fix: Start with a credit union secured card or credit builder. Build the relationship first.

Mistake #3: Maxing Out New Accounts

Why It Hurts: High utilization (using more than 30% of your limit) signals financial stress. Even paying it off monthly, high reported balances hurt your score.

The Fix: Keep utilization under 10% on every account. Pay balances before statement closes.

Mistake #4: Missing Payments

Why It Hurts: One late payment can drop your score 50-100 points and stays on your report for 7 years. Payment history is 35% of your credit score—the single biggest factor.

The Fix: Set up autopay for at least minimum payments. Never miss. Ever.

Mistake #5: Closing Old Accounts

Why It Hurts: Closing accounts reduces your available credit (increasing utilization) and eventually removes account age from your profile. Both hurt your score.

The Fix: Keep old accounts open, even if unused. Use them occasionally to keep them active.

Already Working on Credit Restoration? Add Credit Building.

If you're currently working with Mesa Group on credit restoration, don't wait until it's complete to start building. The most effective strategy is running both simultaneously—removing negatives while adding positives.

Without Credit Building

18 months to fundability

(6 months restoration + 12 months building = 18 months total)

With Credit Building

6-8 months to fundability

(Both running simultaneously = compressed timeline)

Why Credit Monitoring Matters More Than Ever

With identity theft on the rise and credit impacting every major financial decision, monitoring your credit is no longer optional—it's essential.

9 Million Victims/Year

Identity theft and credit fraud affect millions of Americans annually. Early detection is your best defense.

Errors Hurt Your Score

Credit report errors are common and can unfairly lower your score, costing you thousands in higher interest rates.

Major Financial Impact

Your credit score affects mortgage rates, car loans, credit cards, and even job applications.

Can't See What You Don't Track

Without monitoring, you won't know if someone opens accounts in your name until it's too late.

Don't Wait for a Crisis to Start Monitoring

SmartCredit® gives you the tools to catch problems early, dispute errors quickly, and take control of your financial future.

How much does SmartCredit cost?

SmartCredit offers an incredible $1 trial for 7 days so you can experience full 3-bureau credit monitoring with zero risk. After your 7-day trial, SmartCredit continues at $27.99 per month. This includes daily credit monitoring from all 3 bureaus, real-time alerts for changes to your credit, credit score tracking and analysis, and identity theft protection features. You can cancel anytime with no long-term commitment required.

Why do I need to monitor all 3 credit bureaus?

Each credit bureau (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) maintains separate records. One bureau may have more or fewer inquiries than the others, which could produce different credit reports and scores. Monitoring all three ensures you have a comprehensive view of your credit and can quickly identify discrepancies.

How often is my credit information updated?

Your credit reports are updated monthly, and you'll receive real-time alerts whenever changes occur to your credit profile. This includes new accounts, inquiries, late payments, or suspicious activity.

Will checking my credit hurt my score?

No. When you check your own credit through SmartCredit®, it's considered a "soft inquiry" which does not impact your credit score. Only "hard inquiries" from lenders when you apply for credit can affect your score.

What's included in the $1 Million fraud insurance?

The Identity Fraud Expense Reimbursement covers expenses related to identity theft for you and your entire household. This includes legal fees, lost wages, document replacement costs, and other expenses incurred while resolving identity theft issues.

Can I cancel anytime?

Yes. You can cancel your SmartCredit® membership at any time with no penalties or fees. You'll pay any accumulated, unbilled charges through the date of cancellation. You may reactivate your membership at any time.

How do I dispute errors on my credit report?

SmartCredit® makes disputing errors simple with Action Buttons built into your credit report dashboard. When you identify an error, click the Action Button to communicate directly with the creditor or credit bureau to initiate the dispute process.

Important: Soft Pull vs. Hard Pull

Tired of Seeing "DECLINED" While Everyone Else Earns Rewards on Every Purchase?

Another rejection. Another form asking for perfect credit you don't have. You watch friends earn cash back and travel rewards while you're stuck paying cash for everything—no credit building, no benefits, no path forward.

— Credit Card Industry Study, 2024

What to Compare When Choosing a Card

Don't just look at the rewards. Here's what actually matters:

APR (Interest Rate)

The rate you pay on unpaid balances. Lower is always better.

Range: 15.99% - 29.99%. Excellent credit gets lowest rates.

Annual Fee

Yearly cost to keep the card. $0 - $695+.

Premium cards charge fees but offer valuable perks. Do the math.

Rewards Rate

Cashback percentage or points per dollar spent.

Typical: 1-2% base, 3-5% in bonus categories. Check the fine print.

Sign-Up Bonus

One-time reward for hitting spending threshold.

Example: "Spend $3K in 3 months, get $200." Factor in your budget.

Foreign Transaction Fee

Charge for purchases outside the US (typically 3%).

If you travel internationally, look for $0 foreign fees.

Credit Limit

Maximum you can charge. Affects utilization ratio.

Higher limits = better utilization = higher credit score.

Picture Your Credit Score Rising. See Yourself Getting Approved. Imagine Earning Rewards Again.

Imagine checking your credit score next month—watching it climb. Getting approved for that premium card. Earning 3% cash back on groceries. Booking flights with points you earned. That financial confidence you deserve is one decision away.

Common Credit Card Questions

Get answers to common questions about credit cards and pre-qualification.

Will checking my pre-qualification hurt my credit score?

No. Pre-qualification uses a 'soft pull' which doesn't affect your credit score at all. Soft pulls are visible only to you, not to lenders. Only when you actually APPLY for a card (after pre-qualification) does a hard pull happen, which may lower your score by 5-10 points temporarily.

What's the difference between pre-qualification and pre-approval?

Pre-qualification is a quick estimate based on self-reported info (soft pull, no score impact). Pre-approval is more thorough, often involves a hard pull, and means you're very likely to be approved. Our tool shows pre-qualification first—apply when ready for the hard pull.

What credit score do I need to get approved?

It depends on the card. Secured cards accept 300+ scores. Standard cards want 580-669 (fair credit). Rewards cards prefer 670+ (good credit). Premium travel cards need 740+ (excellent). Our comparison tool shows you which cards match YOUR score range.

Should I close old credit cards I don't use?

Usually no. Closing old cards reduces your total available credit (increases utilization) and shortens your credit history—both hurt your score. Better strategy: Keep old cards open, use them occasionally for small purchases, pay off immediately.

How many credit cards should I have?

There's no magic number, but most credit experts recommend 2-4 cards for optimal credit building. Multiple cards increase total credit limit (lowers utilization), provides backup options, and can maximize rewards in different categories. Just don't apply for many at once.

What if I get denied after applying?

Call the issuer's reconsideration line within 30 days and ask why you were denied. Sometimes you can provide additional info (income proof, explanation of credit issues) and get approved. If not, wait 6 months, improve your credit, and try again or apply for a different card.

Can I get a credit card with no credit history?

Yes. Start with a secured credit card (requires deposit) or become an authorized user on someone else's card. Student cards and credit builder cards also work. After 6-12 months of on-time payments, you'll qualify for standard unsecured cards.

How do I maximize credit card rewards?

Strategy: (1) Use cards in their bonus categories (5% on gas, 3% on dining, etc.), (2) Pay off balance monthly to avoid interest (which wipes out rewards), (3) Take advantage of sign-up bonuses, (4) Consider a 2% flat cashback card for everything else.

Credit Score Ranges & What They Mean

Your credit score determines which cards you qualify for. Here's the breakdown:

800 - 850
Exceptional

Best rates on everything. Premium cards welcome you.

740 - 799
Very Good

Great rates. Most premium cards available.

670 - 739
Good

Above-average rates. Solid rewards cards accessible.

580 - 669
Fair

Higher rates. Limited to rebuilding cards.

300 - 579
Poor

Secured cards only. Focus on rebuilding.

Don't Know Your Credit Score?

Our comparison tool will estimate your score range based on your credit profile. Or check your score free at Credit Karma, Experian, or through your bank.

Frequently Asked Questions

Get answers to common questions about personal loans and our comparison service.

Will checking rates affect my credit score?

No! When you check rates through our platform, we only use a soft credit inquiry, which does not impact your credit score. Only when you formally apply with a specific lender will they perform a hard credit pull—and only after you've chosen to proceed.

How fast can I get funded?

Once approved by a lender, funds are typically deposited into your bank account within 1-3 business days. Some lenders offer same-day or next-day funding for an additional fee. The overall timeline from application to funding is usually 2-5 business days.

What credit score do I need to qualify?

While many lenders prefer credit scores of 640+, our network includes lenders who work with scores as low as 580 or even lower. Your credit score affects your interest rate more than your approval odds. Better credit typically means lower rates.

Can I use a personal loan for any purpose?

Yes! Personal loans are unsecured and can be used for almost any legal purpose—debt consolidation, home improvements, medical bills, major purchases, business expenses, education, and more. Some lenders may ask what you'll use the funds for, but there are no restrictions.

What's the difference between a personal loan and a credit card?

Personal loans provide a lump sum with fixed monthly payments over a set term (e.g., 36 months), typically at lower interest rates than credit cards. Credit cards are revolving credit with variable payments and higher APRs. For large expenses or debt consolidation, personal loans usually save more money.

Are there any fees I should know about?

Some lenders charge an origination fee (typically 1-6% of the loan amount), which is deducted from your loan proceeds. Other potential fees include late payment fees and failed payment fees. Many lenders do not charge prepayment penalties, allowing you to pay off your loan early without penalty. Always review the loan terms before accepting an offer.

How much can I borrow?

Loan amounts in our network range from $1,000 to $100,000, depending on the lender and your qualifications. Most borrowers qualify for $5,000 to $35,000. Your approved amount depends on your income, credit score, existing debts, and the lender's criteria.

What documents will I need to apply?

Typically, you'll need: proof of identity (driver's license or state ID), proof of income (recent pay stubs, W-2s, or bank statements), Social Security Number, proof of address, and bank account information. Self-employed applicants may need tax returns or additional documentation.

Can I pay off my loan early?

Most lenders in our network allow early payoff without penalties, which can save you money on interest. However, some lenders do charge prepayment penalties, so always check the loan terms before accepting an offer.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Missing a payment can result in late fees (typically $15-$30) and negative marks on your credit report if the payment is more than 30 days late. If you're struggling to make payments, contact your lender immediately—many offer hardship programs or payment arrangements.

Is Mesa Group Consulting a lender?

No, Mesa Group Consulting is not a lender. We are a financial services marketplace that connects consumers with multiple lending partners. We do not make lending decisions or fund loans—we simply help you compare offers from our network of trusted lenders.

How do you make money if the service is free?

Our service is free for consumers. We earn a referral fee from lenders when you successfully complete a loan through our platform. This does not affect your interest rate or loan terms—lenders pay us for connecting them with qualified borrowers.

Is Auto Loan Refinancing Right for You?

Refinancing makes sense in these common situations. If any of these apply to you, you could save money.

Your Credit Improved

If your credit score has increased since you bought your car, you likely qualify for a better rate now.

Interest Rates Dropped

If rates have fallen 1-2% or more since your original loan, refinancing could save you thousands.

Payment Too High

Struggling with high monthly payments? Refinance to extend your term and lower your payment.

Dealer Marked Up Rate

Dealers often mark up interest rates. You may have been overcharged and can get a better deal now.

Remove Co-Signer

If you needed a co-signer originally but your credit has improved, refinance to remove them from the loan.

What Auto Refi Rates Can I Expect?

Excellent
3.99%-5.49%
Credit: 750+

Best rates available. Lenders compete for you.

Good
5.5%-7.99%
Credit: 700-749

Great rates. Plenty of lender options.

Fair
8%-11.99%
Credit: 640-699

Moderate rates. Good lender selection.

Poor
12%-16.99%
Credit: 580-639

Higher rates but still worth comparing.

❌
Bad
17%-23%
Credit: 500-579

Limited options. Still better than predatory lenders.

How Credit Improvement Affects Your Savings

Example: $25,000 loan balance, 48 months remaining

7.5% APR
Current Rate (Fair Credit)
$603/month
Total Cost: $28,944
5.5% APR
New Rate (Good Credit)
$580/month
Total Cost: $27,840
4.0% APR
Best Rate (Excellent Credit)

Total Cost: $27,024

Improving your credit from fair to excellent saves $40/month and $1,920 total!

Auto Loan Refinancing Requirements
What You'll Need to Apply
✓
Vehicle Information: Year, make, model, mileage, VIN
✓
Current Loan Details: Remaining balance, current lender name, monthly payment
✓
Personal Info: Name, address, SSN, date of birth
✓
Income Verification: Pay stubs, tax returns, or bank statements
✓
Proof of Insurance: Current auto insurance card

Don't worry—most of this you can fill in from memory. Documents only needed if you accept a loan.

Typical Lender Requirements
•
Vehicle Age: Typically less than 10 years old (some lenders go up to 15 years)
•
Loan Balance: Usually $7,500 - $100,000 remaining
•
Vehicle Value: Must not be "upside-down" (owe more than car's worth)
•
Credit Score: Minimum 500-580 for most lenders
•
Time Since Purchase: Wait at least 60-90 days from original loan

Requirements vary by lender. Our platform shows you which lenders you qualify for.

Important: What If I'm "Upside-Down" on My Loan?

Being "upside-down" means you owe more on your loan than your car is currently worth. For example, if you owe $18,000 but your car is only worth $15,000, you're upside-down by $3,000.

Can you still refinance? It depends. Some lenders will refinance upside-down loans, but you may:

•
Need to pay the difference before refinancing
•
Get a higher interest rate
•
Roll the negative equity into the new loan (not ideal)

How to check: Look up your car's value on Kelley Blue Book (kbb.com), then compare it to your loan payoff amount (call your current lender).

Picture an Extra $150 in Your Pocket Each Month. Imagine Owning Your Car Outright Sooner.

Imagine redirecting those savings toward a vacation fund, emergency cushion, or paying off your car a year early. Watching your balance drop faster while your credit score climbs. That financial flexibility you deserve is one decision away.

Common Questions About Auto Loan Refinancing

Get answers to common questions about refinancing your auto loan.

Will refinancing my car loan hurt my credit score?

Checking your rates through our platform uses a soft credit check, which does NOT hurt your credit score. You can compare offers from 100+ lenders with zero credit impact. When you formally accept a loan and the lender does final verification, there will be a hard credit inquiry, which may temporarily lower your score by a few points. However, if you make all your refinanced loan payments on time, your credit score will improve over time.

How much can I actually save by refinancing my car loan?

It depends on your current rate, new rate, and loan balance. On average, borrowers save $50-$150/month and $1,200-$3,600 over the life of the loan. Even a 1-2% rate drop can save thousands. For example, refinancing a $20,000 loan from 7.5% to 4.5% APR saves you about $26/month and $1,248 in total interest over 48 months. Your actual savings depend on your situation.

How soon after buying my car can I refinance?

You should wait at least 60-90 days after your original loan before refinancing. This gives time for the vehicle title to transfer properly, which is required before any lender will approve a refinance. Some borrowers with excellent credit can refinance earlier, but 60-90 days is the safe minimum for most people.

Can I refinance if I bought my car from a dealer?

Yes! It doesn't matter where you bought your car—dealership, private party, or even if you financed through the dealer. You can refinance with any lender on our platform. In fact, many dealers mark up interest rates, so refinancing away from dealer financing often gets you a better deal.

What if my car is really old or has high mileage?

Most lenders require cars to be less than 10 years old, though some go up to 15 years. High mileage can affect eligibility and rates—lenders typically prefer vehicles under 100,000-125,000 miles, but some will work with higher mileage. The older or higher-mileage your car, the fewer lenders you'll qualify for, but it's still worth checking your options.

Can I refinance to remove a co-signer from my loan?

Yes! This is one of the most common reasons people refinance. If you needed a co-signer originally but your credit has improved, you can refinance into a new loan in your name only, removing the co-signer from responsibility. This gives both you and your co-signer financial independence.

Will my monthly payment definitely go down?

Not necessarily—it depends on your goals. If you want a lower monthly payment, you can refinance to a lower rate or extend your loan term. If you want to pay off your car faster, you can refinance to a shorter term, which increases your monthly payment but saves you interest. The choice is yours based on your financial goals.

Are there any fees for refinancing my car loan?

Our comparison platform is 100% free to use. However, some lenders may charge: (1) loan origination fees (typically 1-2% of loan amount), (2) title transfer fees (usually $50-$150, depending on your state), (3) lien filing fees (varies by state). These fees are clearly disclosed before you accept any loan offer. Many lenders have $0 origination fees.

What happens to my old auto loan when I refinance?

Your new lender pays off your old loan in full and closes that account. You'll start making payments to your new lender under the new terms. The process is seamless—you don't need to coordinate anything between lenders. Your new lender handles all the paperwork and title transfer.

Can I refinance a leased vehicle?

Technically, no—you can't refinance a lease because you don't own the car. However, you can do a 'lease buyout' where you purchase the leased vehicle and finance it with a loan. Some of our lending partners offer lease buyout financing. If you're interested in keeping your leased car, this is an option worth exploring.

Real Drivers, Real Savings

See how others lowered their car payments by refinancing through our platform.

"Refinanced my 2021 Honda Accord from 8.2% to 4.8% APR. My payment dropped from $498 to $441/month. That's an extra $57/month for groceries and gas!"

Christina M.

Saved $57/month • $2,280 total

"I bought my truck at a dealership and got stuck with a 9.5% interest rate. Refinanced 4 months later at 5.2% and I'm saving over $120/month. Wish I'd known sooner!"

David R.

Saved $120/month • $6,240 total

"My credit score went from 640 to 710 over the past year. Refinanced my SUV and knocked 3% off my rate. The whole process took 10 days and saved me $4,100 in interest."

Turn Your Student Debt Into Opportunity

Student loan refinancing replaces your existing federal or private student loans with a new loan at a lower interest rate. This can significantly reduce your monthly payments and the total amount you'll pay over the life of the loan.

How It Works
1️⃣
New Lender Pays Off Old Loans

A new lender pays off all your existing student loans in full

2️⃣
You Get One New Loan

You receive a single new loan with better terms and lower rate

3️⃣
Start Saving Money

Lower interest means more money in your pocket every month

Check My Rates (Won't Affect Credit)
Why Thousands of Graduates Are Refinancing

Refinancing your student loans can unlock financial freedom and help you achieve your goals faster

📉
Lower Interest Rates

Secure a competitive rate based on your current credit score and income—often significantly lower than your original student loan rates. Even a 1% reduction can save you thousands.

💰
Reduced Monthly Payments

Free up cash flow each month by extending your repayment term or lowering your interest rate. Use the extra money for savings, investing, or other financial goals.

🎯
Simplified Repayment

Combine multiple student loans into one convenient monthly payment. No more juggling different due dates, servicers, or payment amounts.

⏰
Flexible Term Options

Choose a repayment term that fits your budget—from 5 to 20 years. Shorter terms mean less interest paid overall; longer terms provide lower monthly payments.

👥
Remove a Cosigner

If you had a cosigner on your original loans, refinancing in your name alone can release them from that obligation and give you full financial independence.

🚀
Pay Off Debt Faster

Lower rates mean more of your payment goes toward principal. You can become debt-free years earlier without increasing your monthly payment.

Is Student Loan Refinancing Right for You?

Refinancing works best for borrowers who meet these criteria

✓
Good to Excellent Credit (650+)

Your credit score significantly impacts the rates you'll qualify for. A score of 650 or higher typically unlocks competitive offers. The higher your score, the better your rate.

✓
Steady Income

Lenders want to see reliable income that demonstrates your ability to repay. Full-time employment or consistent self-employment income qualifies.

✓
High-Interest Private Loans

If your current loans have rates above 6-7%, refinancing can lead to substantial savings. Private student loans are especially good candidates for refinancing.

⚠️
Federal Loans You're Willing to Convert

Federal loans come with unique protections (income-driven repayment, forgiveness programs). If you don't need these benefits, refinancing can save you money. Consider carefully before refinancing federal loans.

✓
No Plans for Loan Forgiveness

If you're pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) or other federal programs, keep federal loans separate and don't refinance them. Refinancing makes you ineligible for forgiveness.

Common Questions About Student Loan Refinancing

Get answers to your most pressing questions about refinancing.

Will checking rates affect my credit score?

No. Our rate comparison uses a soft credit check, which doesn't impact your score. Only when you formally apply with a lender will a hard inquiry be performed.

How long does refinancing take?

Most borrowers complete the process in 2-4 weeks. Rate comparison takes 2 minutes, and applications typically take 15-30 minutes to complete.

Can I refinance federal and private loans together?

Yes. Many lenders allow you to consolidate both federal and private loans into a single new loan. Remember, federal loans will lose their protections if refinanced.

What credit score do I need?

Most lenders require a minimum score of 650, though the best rates go to borrowers with scores above 700. Some lenders offer options for borrowers with lower scores.

Can I refinance multiple times?

Absolutely. Many borrowers refinance again when rates drop or their credit improves. There's no limit to how many times you can refinance.

Are there fees to refinance?

Most lenders don't charge application, origination, or prepayment fees. However, always read the terms carefully before accepting an offer.

Important Disclosure: Mesa Group Consulting is a marketing service that connects consumers with lending partners. We do not make credit decisions. Rates, terms, and conditions are determined by your chosen lender. Refinancing federal student loans eliminates federal benefits including income-driven repayment, loan forgiveness programs, and deferment options. Consider carefully before refinancing federal loans. Not all applicants will qualify. Your actual rate depends on credit score, income, and other factors.

Why Refinance Your Student Loans?

Refinancing can help you save money, simplify payments, and pay off your debt faster.

Lower Your Interest Rate

If your credit has improved or market rates have dropped, you could qualify for a significantly lower rate—saving thousands over time.

Reduce Monthly Payments

Lower rates or extended terms can reduce your monthly burden, freeing up cash for other goals like buying a home or building savings.

Simplify Multiple Loans

Combine several loans into one convenient payment with a single lender, eliminating confusion and missed payments.

Choose Your Repayment Term

Select a term (5-20 years) that fits your budget and goals—pay off faster to save on interest, or extend for lower monthly payments.

Release Your Co-signer

If you originally needed a co-signer but now qualify on your own, refinancing can release them from the loan obligation.

No Prepayment Penalties

Most lenders don't charge fees for paying off your loan early, allowing you to save even more by accelerating payments.

Tired of Watching $800+ Vanish Every Month While Your Loan Balance Barely Moves?

Your friends are buying homes, starting families, building savings—while your student loans keep you stuck. Every payment at that high rate is throwing money away to interest. You graduated to build a future, not spend a decade trapped by debt you can't escape.

Who Should Refinance?

Refinancing isn't right for everyone. Here's how to know if it makes sense for you.

You're a Good Candidate If:
Your credit score has improved since taking out your loans (typically 650+ required)
You have stable employment and steady income
Your current interest rate is 6% or higher
You have private student loans or can afford to lose federal loan benefits
You want to simplify multiple loan payments
You're comfortable with a private lender
You Might Want to Wait If:
You're relying on income-driven repayment plans
You're pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)
You need federal forbearance or deferment options
Your income is unstable or you may face unemployment
You have poor credit (under 650) and no co-signer
You're currently in school or grace period

Important Note:

If you have federal student loans, carefully weigh the benefits of a lower rate against the loss of federal protections before refinancing. Once you refinance federal loans with a private lender, you cannot get those federal benefits back.

What If Refinancing Could Save You $288/Month and Cut Years Off Your Repayment?

Through our SuperMoney partnership, compare 10+ lenders in minutes—no credit score impact. Lower your rate 1-3%, reduce monthly payments, or pay off faster. We see your potential for financial freedom where lenders see only numbers. One soft credit check could save you $10,000+.

Fixed vs Variable Interest Rates

Understanding your rate options helps you choose the best loan for your situation

Fixed Rate

Your interest rate stays the same for the entire loan term, providing predictable monthly payments.

Pros:
Predictable monthly payments
Protected if rates increase
Easier to budget
Peace of mind
Cons:
Typically higher initial rate
Won't benefit if rates drop

Best for: Risk-averse borrowers who want payment stability

Variable Rate

Your rate can change based on market conditions, typically tied to LIBOR or SOFR benchmarks.

Pros:
Lower initial rate
Can save more if rates drop
Good for short-term loans
Often includes rate caps
Cons:
Unpredictable payments
Could increase significantly

Best for: Borrowers planning to pay off quickly or expecting rates to fall

Making Your Choice

Most borrowers choose fixed rates for the predictability and peace of mind. However, variable rates can work well if you plan to pay off your loan quickly (within 5 years) or if you expect rates to remain stable or decrease.

Compare offers for both rate types to see which saves you the most based on your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Picture Yourself Debt-Free Five Years Sooner. See That Down Payment Growing.

Imagine an extra $300 every month—building your emergency fund, saving for a home, finally taking that trip. Watching your loan balance actually shrink instead of treading water. Owning your financial future instead of renting it from your lender. Your financial freedom is one decision away.

Frequently Asked Questions

Get answers to common questions about student loan refinancing.

Will checking my rate hurt my credit score?
No! Checking your rate only requires a soft credit pull, which doesn't affect your credit score. Only when you formally apply with a lender will a hard credit inquiry be performed.
How much can I save by refinancing my student loans?
Savings vary based on your current rate, new rate, and loan balance. On average, borrowers save $20,000+ over the life of their loan. Some save even more if they have high-interest private loans or significant debt.
Can I refinance both federal and private student loans?
Yes, you can refinance both federal and private loans into one new private loan. However, refinancing federal loans means losing federal benefits like income-driven repayment, PSLF, and forbearance options.
What credit score do I need to refinance?
Most lenders require a minimum credit score of 650-660, though some may work with scores as low as 640. The higher your credit score, the better rate you'll qualify for.
How long does the refinancing process take?
Checking rates takes just 2-3 minutes. Once you choose a lender and apply, the process typically takes 2-4 weeks from application to disbursement.
What is the minimum loan amount I can refinance?
Most lenders require a minimum balance of $5,000 to refinance. There's typically a maximum of $300,000-$500,000 depending on the lender.
Do I need to be employed to refinance?
Yes, most lenders require steady employment and verifiable income. Some lenders may consider other income sources like spousal income or investments.
Can I refinance while I'm still in school?
No, you typically need to have graduated and completed your grace period before refinancing. Lenders want to see you've established employment and steady income.
Will I lose my grace period if I refinance?
Yes, refinancing converts your loans into a new private loan with immediate repayment. However, some lenders offer a brief forbearance period after refinancing.
What happens to my original loans when I refinance?
Your new lender pays off your existing loans directly. Your original loans are closed, and you'll only have the new refinanced loan to repay.

Important Considerations

Understand what you're giving up when refinancing federal student loans

Federal Benefits You'll Lose When Refinancing:
Income-Driven Repayment Plans - Payments based on your income and family size
Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) - Forgiveness after 10 years of public service employment
Forbearance & Deferment - Temporarily pause payments during hardship
Loan Forgiveness Programs - Teacher forgiveness, disability discharge, death discharge
Federal Consolidation - Ability to consolidate federal loans in the future
Flexible Payment Options - Graduated, extended, and alternative repayment plans

⚠️ This is a one-way decision. Once you refinance federal loans, you cannot convert them back.

When Refinancing Makes Sense:
Your savings significantly outweigh the value of federal protections
You have stable employment in the private sector
You don't anticipate needing income-driven repayment
You're not pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness
You have an emergency fund to cover 6+ months of expenses
Your career path is stable with low unemployment risk

Why Choose Debt Consolidation?

Debt consolidation isn't about taking on more debt—it's about replacing expensive, chaotic debt with a structured plan to become debt-free faster while paying less interest.

Simplify Multiple Debts Into One

Stop tracking 5 different due dates, minimum payments, and interest rates. Consolidate credit cards, medical bills, and other debts into a single loan with one predictable monthly payment.

Lower Your Interest Rate

Credit cards average 20-25% APR. With a debt consolidation loan, you could qualify for rates as low as 5.99% APR—potentially saving thousands in interest over the life of your loan.

Pay Off Debt Faster

With lower rates and fixed payments, more of your money goes toward principal instead of interest. Most clients become debt-free in 3-5 years instead of decades of minimum payments.

How Debt Consolidation Works

From chaos to clarity in three simple steps—start simplifying your debt today.

1
Enter Your Debt Details

Tell us about your current debts—credit cards, medical bills, personal loans—and how much you want to consolidate. Our quick 3-minute form gathers what lenders need without impacting your credit score.

2
Compare Consolidation Offers

Receive personalized loan offers from multiple lenders within minutes. Compare interest rates, monthly payments, and total savings side-by-side. See exactly how much you'll save vs. your current payments.

3
Consolidate & Start Saving

Choose the best offer and complete your application. Once approved, your new lender pays off your existing debts directly. You'll have one new loan with one lower monthly payment—start saving immediately.

Most clients complete the process in 2-5 business days

Tired of Juggling Five Different Payments While Your Interest Charges Eat Your Paycheck?

Credit cards. Personal loans. Medical bills. Every month, different due dates, different amounts, watching hundreds disappear to interest alone. You're working harder but getting nowhere—trapped in a cycle that never ends while life passes by.

Frequently Asked Questions

Get answers to common questions about debt consolidation loans.

What is debt consolidation?

Debt consolidation is the process of combining multiple debts—like credit cards, medical bills, and personal loans—into a single loan with one monthly payment. The goal is to simplify your finances, lower your interest rate, and pay off debt faster.

Will checking rates affect my credit score?

No! When you check rates through our platform, we only use a soft credit inquiry, which does not impact your credit score. Only when you formally apply with a specific lender will they perform a hard credit pull—and only after you've chosen to proceed.

How much can I save with debt consolidation?

Savings vary based on your current debts and the rate you qualify for. On average, clients who consolidate credit card debt (typically 20-25% APR) into a personal loan (8-15% APR) save $200-$400 per month. Over the life of the loan, this can add up to thousands of dollars in interest savings.

What types of debt can I consolidate?

You can consolidate most unsecured debts including credit cards, medical bills, personal loans, payday loans, collection accounts, and other installment debts. Secured debts like mortgages and auto loans typically require different solutions.

What credit score do I need to qualify?

While many lenders prefer credit scores of 640+, our network includes lenders who work with scores as low as 580 or even lower. Your credit score affects your interest rate more than your approval odds—better credit typically means lower rates.

How fast can I get funded?

Once approved by a lender, funds are typically deposited into your bank account within 1-3 business days. The lender then pays off your existing debts directly. The overall timeline from application to debt payoff is usually 3-7 business days.

Is debt consolidation the same as debt settlement?

No, they are very different. Debt consolidation is a loan that pays off your existing debts in full—you then repay the new loan over time. Debt settlement involves negotiating with creditors to pay less than you owe, which can significantly damage your credit. Consolidation is generally a better option if you can qualify for a loan.

Will I save money if I consolidate?

You'll likely save money if: 1) Your new interest rate is lower than the average of your current rates, 2) You pay off the loan within the term (don't extend your debt timeline significantly), and 3) You don't accumulate new debt on the accounts you paid off. Our comparison tool shows you exactly how much you'll save before you commit.

What happens to my credit cards after I consolidate?

After consolidation, your credit cards will be paid off and have zero balances. You can keep the accounts open (which can help your credit utilization ratio) or close them. Many financial advisors recommend keeping older accounts open but removing temptation by cutting up the physical cards.

Are there any fees I should know about?

Some lenders charge an origination fee (typically 1-6% of the loan amount), which is deducted from your loan proceeds. Other potential fees include late payment fees. Many lenders do not charge prepayment penalties, allowing you to pay off your loan early without penalty. Always review the loan terms before accepting.

Is Mesa Group Consulting a lender?

No, Mesa Group Consulting is not a lender. We are a financial services marketplace that connects consumers with multiple lending partners. We do not make lending decisions or fund loans—we help you compare offers from our network of trusted lenders to find the best solution for your situation.

How is this different from a balance transfer credit card?

Balance transfer cards offer low intro APRs (often 0%) but typically for only 12-21 months, after which rates jump to 20%+. If you can't pay off the balance in that time, you're back to high interest. Debt consolidation loans have fixed rates for the entire term (3-7 years), making them better for larger amounts or longer payoff timelines.

You're not alone. These are the signs that debt relief might be your best option.

Creditor Harassment

Constant collection calls. Threatening letters. Lawsuits filed. You're afraid to answer your phone or check your mail.

Minimum Payment Trap

You're making minimum payments but the balance never goes down. Interest eats up everything you pay—you're running in place.

Can't Afford Payments

You have to choose between debt payments and groceries, rent, or utilities. There's nothing left at the end of the month.

Family Stress

Debt is destroying your peace of mind, your relationships, and your health. You can't see a way out.

There's a Better Way Than Bankruptcy

Debt relief through Mesa Group Consulting lets you settle debts for 30-50% less than you owe, avoid bankruptcy, and protect your family's future—without destroying your credit for 7-10 years.

Once you enroll, we handle all creditor communication. No more collection calls. No more threatening letters. No more stress. Our certified Debt Specialists deal with creditors on your behalf.

One Affordable Monthly Payment

Instead of juggling 5+ creditors with different due dates and amounts, you make one predictable monthly deposit into your own dedicated savings account. Simple. Manageable. Under your control.

Be Debt-Free in 20-48 Months

Most clients achieve complete debt freedom within 4 years or less—with the first settlement typically within 4-7 months. Compare that to 15+ years of minimum payments on credit cards.

What If You Could Eliminate Up to 50% of Your Debt and Finally Breathe Again?

Mesa Group Capital negotiates directly with your creditors—settling your debts for pennies on the dollar while you make one affordable payment based on YOUR budget. No more harassment.

Debt Relief Questions Answered

Get clarity before booking your free consultation.

How does Mesa Group Consulting's Debt Relief program work?

Our program works by negotiating with your creditors to settle debts for 30-50% less than you owe. You stop paying creditors directly and instead make one affordable monthly deposit into a dedicated savings account under your control. As funds accumulate, our expert negotiators work with your creditors to secure settlement offers. When settlements are reached, creditors are paid directly from your account. The entire process typically takes 20-48 months to complete.

Is debt relief better than making minimum payments?

Absolutely. If you only make minimum payments on a $20,000 credit card balance at 18% APR, you'll pay over $50,000 total and take 30+ years to pay it off. With debt relief, you could settle that same debt for $10,000-$14,000 (including fees) and be debt-free in 2-4 years. You save tens of thousands of dollars and decades of stress.

How much will I save with Mesa Group Consulting's program?

On average, clients save 30-50% on enrolled debts (approximately 43% average) before program fees. For example, if you have $30,000 in credit card debt, you might settle for $15,000-$21,000 total, including program fees. Actual savings depend on your creditors, debt types, and negotiation outcomes. During your free consultation, we'll provide a personalized savings estimate.

Do I qualify for debt relief?

You may qualify if: (1) You have at least $10,000 in unsecured debt, (2) You're experiencing financial hardship or struggling with payments, (3) Your debts are with creditors who negotiate with debt relief companies, and (4) Your debts are unsecured (not backed by collateral). Federal student loans, secured debts like mortgages or car loans, child support, and most tax debts typically don't qualify. Book a free consultation to determine your eligibility.

What does Mesa Group Consulting's program cost?

We charge NO UPFRONT FEES. Our fees are performance-based and range from 14-25% of your enrolled debt amount, charged only as debts are successfully settled. For example, on $30,000 enrolled debt with a 20% fee structure, our total fees would be $6,000, paid gradually as each debt settles. You pay nothing until we deliver results. This is required by FTC regulations.

What's the difference between debt relief and debt consolidation?

Debt consolidation combines multiple debts into one loan—you still owe 100% of the principal plus interest, and you need good credit to qualify. Debt relief (settlement) negotiates with creditors to reduce the total amount you owe by 30-50%. You don't need good credit to qualify for debt relief, and you end up paying significantly less than you originally owed.

How long will it take to be debt-free?

Most debt relief programs take 20-48 months to complete, depending on your total debt amount, monthly deposit capacity, and creditor cooperation. Your first settlement typically occurs within 4-7 months of enrollment, with additional settlements approximately every 3-6 months thereafter. We'll provide a realistic timeline during your consultation based on your specific situation.

Will debt relief impact my credit score?

Yes, debt relief will likely have a negative impact on your credit score temporarily because you'll stop making payments to creditors during negotiations. However, if your credit is already damaged from late payments or collections, the impact may be minimal. The alternative—bankruptcy—is far more damaging and lasts 7-10 years. Debt relief allows you to rebuild credit faster after completion, and most clients see their scores recover within 2-3 years.

Can you help if I'm already facing lawsuits or judgments?

Yes! We can often negotiate settlements even after lawsuits are filed or judgments are entered. Early intervention is best, but we work with collection attorneys and creditors at all stages of the collection process. In some cases, we can negotiate to stop wage garnishments or bank levies as part of settlement agreements.

What happens if I can't complete the program?

You can withdraw from the program at any time without penalty. If you withdraw, you'll receive all funds from your dedicated savings account, minus any fees earned by Mesa Group Consulting for completed settlements and any fees paid to third-party service providers. We work with you to create sustainable payment plans, but life circumstances change and we understand that.

Why Estate Planning Matters

Without a Will or Trust, state law decides what happens to your assets and children. Don't leave it to chance.

Protect Your Children

Name guardians for minor children. Without a Will, the court decides who raises your kids.

Control Your Assets

Decide who gets your home, savings, investments, and possessions—not the government.

Avoid Probate Court

With a Trust, assets transfer privately and quickly—no lengthy court process or public records.

Specify Medical Wishes

Document healthcare preferences and assign someone to make medical decisions if you can't.

Give Peace of Mind

Protect your family from stress, confusion, and conflict during an already difficult time.

What Happens Without an Estate Plan?
•
Courts decide who raises your children
•
State law dictates asset distribution (may not match your wishes)
•
Estate goes through probate (6-24 months, 3-7% fees)
•
Financial affairs become public record
•
Family conflict and legal battles over assets

Common Questions About Estate Planning

Get answers to common questions about Wills, Trusts, and estate planning.

Is an online Will or Trust legally binding?

Yes, absolutely. Our estate planning documents are built by licensed attorneys and customized to meet your specific state's legal requirements. Once you sign them according to your state's witness and notarization requirements (which we provide clear instructions for), they are 100% legally binding and enforceable in court. Thousands of families use online estate planning documents successfully every year.

What's the difference between a Will and a Trust?

A Will takes effect after you die and goes through probate court (a public, 6-12 month process). A Trust takes effect immediately, holds your assets during your lifetime, and transfers them privately after death—avoiding probate entirely. Both name guardians for children and specify your wishes. Choose a Will if you have a modest estate and don't mind probate. Choose a Trust if you own a home, want privacy, or have significant assets ($100K+).

Do I need an attorney to create a Will or Trust?

No. Our platform is built BY attorneys but designed FOR everyday people to use without legal help. The documents are attorney-crafted, state-specific templates that you customize by answering simple questions. It's the same quality as hiring an attorney, but you save $2,000-$5,000 and avoid multiple appointments. However, if your estate is extremely complex (business ownership, international assets, special needs trusts), you may want to consult with an attorney.

What happens if I don't have a Will or Trust?

If you die without a Will or Trust, you die 'intestate' and state law decides what happens to your assets and who raises your children. This process (called intestate succession) may not match your wishes at all. For example, if you're unmarried with kids, your assets might go to your parents instead of your children. Courts will appoint guardians for your kids—possibly someone you wouldn't choose. Plus, your estate goes through probate, which costs 3-7% of your estate value and takes 6-24 months.

Can I update my Will or Trust after I create it?

Yes! Life changes (marriage, divorce, new children, moving states), and your estate plan should change with it. With a Will plan, you can log back in anytime and create an updated version for a small fee. With a Trust plan, your first year of membership is FREE ($39/year after), which includes unlimited updates. You can add assets, change beneficiaries, update guardians, or make any other changes whenever needed.

How do I know which plan to choose—Will or Trust?

Choose a Will if: you're young (under 40), have minimal assets (under $100K), don't own a home, and are okay with the probate process. Choose a Trust if: you own a home, have assets over $100K, want to avoid probate, value privacy, want faster asset transfer, or have a complex family situation (blended family, children from multiple relationships). Most homeowners choose the Trust plan. Still not sure? The questionnaire will help guide you.

What if I live in multiple states or plan to move?

Your estate planning documents are state-specific and based on where you currently live. If you move to a new state, you should update your documents to comply with that state's laws. With membership (included free first year with Trust plan), you can easily update your documents for your new state. Some states have significantly different requirements, so updating is important.

Do I need witnesses or a notary?

It depends on your state. Most states require 2-3 witnesses for Wills (who are NOT beneficiaries), and some also require notarization. Trusts typically require notarization but not witnesses. We provide clear, state-specific instructions on exactly what your state requires. You can find notaries at banks, UPS stores, or use online notarization services (available in most states).

Can my spouse and I create one joint Will or Trust?

We recommend each spouse have their own separate Will or Trust (called 'mirror' documents). This is the standard legal practice and avoids complications. Our couples pricing bundles two individual plans together at a discount ($299 for Will couples plan, $599 for Trust couples plan). Each spouse's documents work together but remain legally separate.

What if I have minor children? How do I name guardians?

Both the Will and Trust plans allow you to nominate guardians for your minor children (and pets!). You can name a primary guardian and backup guardians. If something happens to both parents, the court will appoint your chosen guardian to raise your children. Without a Will or Trust, the court decides who raises your kids—which may not be who you'd want. Naming guardians is one of the most important reasons parents create estate plans.

Who Needs Estate Planning?

You don't need to be wealthy or elderly to need an estate plan. If any of these apply to you, you need a Will or Trust today.

Parents with Minor Children

Critical need: Without a Will, courts decide who raises your children if something happens to you.

•
Name guardians for kids (and pets)
•
Set up trusts for minor children
•
Protect inheritance until they're adults
Recommended: Will Plan minimum, Trust Plan ideal
Homeowners

Save your family thousands: Probate costs 3-7% of estate value. On a $500K home, that's $15K-$35K in legal fees.

•
Avoid probate with a Trust
•
Transfer property immediately
•
Keep real estate affairs private
Recommended: Trust Plan (avoids probate)
Blended Families

Prevent family conflict: State law may give assets to people you don't intend. Clearly document your wishes.

•
Protect children from previous marriage
•
Balance current spouse & kids' needs
•
Add conditions to distributions
Recommended: Trust Plan (more control)
Unmarried Couples

No automatic rights: Without marriage, your partner gets NOTHING by default. State law gives everything to blood relatives.

•
Leave assets to your partner
•
Grant medical decision-making rights
•
Prevent family from contesting wishes
Recommended: Will Plan minimum, Trust Plan ideal
Business Owners

Protect your business: Without planning, your business could be frozen or sold during probate, destroying value.

•
Plan business succession
•
Avoid probate disruption
•
Transfer ownership smoothly
Recommended: Trust Plan + business attorney
Anyone Over 40

Life is unpredictable: Accidents, illness, and incapacity can happen at any age. Protect yourself and your family.

•
Document healthcare wishes
•
Assign Power of Attorney
•
Give family clear guidance
Recommended: Will Plan at minimum
High Net Worth Individuals

Significant assets ($500K+): Probate is expensive, public, and slow. Trusts protect wealth and privacy.

•
Minimize estate taxes
•
Keep financial details private
•
Control how/when heirs receive assets
Recommended: Trust Plan essential
Pet Parents

Protect your pets: Without planning, your pets could end up in shelters. Name caregivers and set aside funds.

•
Name pet guardians
•
Allocate money for pet care
•
Document care instructions
Recommended: Will Plan at minimum
Digital Asset Owners

Modern wealth: Cryptocurrency, online businesses, digital art, and social media accounts need planning too.

•
Document cryptocurrency access
•
Assign digital executor
•
Plan for online business transfer
Recommended: Trust Plan
The Truth: Everyone Needs Estate Planning

If you have anyone you care about, anything you own, or any wishes for your care, you need an estate plan.

It's not about age or wealth—it's about protecting the people and things you love. The average cost of creating an estate plan online is $199-$599. The average cost of NOT having one is $15,000-$50,000+ in probate fees, plus months of stress for your family.

Which would you rather invest in?

Real Families, Real Peace of Mind

See how families across America are protecting their loved ones with Trust & Will.

"As a new mom, I kept putting off creating a Will because I thought it would be complicated and expensive. This platform made it SO easy. In 20 minutes, I named guardians for my daughter and designated where everything goes. The peace of mind is priceless."

Rachel M.

Will Estate Plan • New parent

"My wife and I own our home and have investment accounts. We knew we needed a Trust to avoid probate but didn't want to spend $5,000 on an attorney. For $599, we got everything we needed—state-specific, legally binding, and done from our couch in under an hour."

David & Jennifer K.

Trust Estate Plan • Homeowners

"My dad passed away without a Will and the probate process was a nightmare—9 months, tons of legal fees, and family fighting. I swore I'd never put my kids through that. Creating my Trust online was the smartest thing I've ever done. My estate will transfer immediately with zero court involvement."

Frequently Asked Questions

Get answers to common questions about life insurance and our service.

How much life insurance do I need?

A common rule of thumb is 10-12 times your annual income. However, the right amount depends on your specific situation including debts, income, dependents, and long-term financial goals. PolicyGenius agents can help you calculate the optimal coverage amount for your family's needs.

How much does life insurance cost?

Term life insurance is surprisingly affordable—many healthy individuals in their 30s can get $500,000 in coverage for $20-30 per month. Costs vary based on age, health, lifestyle habits (smoking), coverage amount, and policy type. Get a free personalized quote to see exact pricing for your situation.

Do I need a medical exam?

Most traditional policies require a medical exam, which is typically free and completed at your home or workplace. The exam includes basic measurements (height, weight, blood pressure) and blood/urine samples. Some policies offer no-exam options, though they may have higher premiums or lower coverage limits.

What's the difference between term and whole life insurance?

Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period (10, 20, or 30 years) and is typically more affordable. Whole life insurance provides permanent coverage for your entire life and builds cash value, but costs significantly more. Term is best for temporary needs; whole life is better for estate planning and long-term wealth building.

Can I get life insurance if I have health conditions?

Yes. Many people with health conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or even cancer history can still qualify for coverage. Insurers will consider your specific condition, how well it's managed, and overall health. Some conditions may result in higher premiums, but coverage is often still available.

How long does the application process take?

The entire process typically takes 2-6 weeks from application to approval. You can complete the online application in 10-15 minutes, schedule your medical exam within days, and most approvals come within 24-48 hours after the exam. Some policies offer instant decisions for qualifying applicants.

Is the death benefit taxable?

No. Life insurance death benefits are generally income-tax-free to your beneficiaries. This is one of the key advantages of life insurance—your loved ones receive the full benefit amount without tax implications. However, the cash value growth in permanent policies may have tax considerations; consult a tax advisor for specifics.

Can I change my coverage amount later?

It depends on your policy type. Term life insurance typically has fixed coverage for the term length, though some policies offer conversion options to permanent coverage. Whole and universal life policies often allow adjustments to death benefits and premiums (subject to underwriting). It's generally easier to decrease coverage than increase it.

What if I miss a premium payment?

Most policies have a grace period (typically 30-31 days) after your payment due date. If you pay within the grace period, your coverage continues uninterrupted. If you miss the grace period, your policy may lapse. Contact your insurer immediately if you're having payment difficulties—they may offer options.

Do I need life insurance if I'm young and single?

Even if you don't have dependents, life insurance can make sense if you have: (1) cosigned student loans or other debts that family would inherit, (2) want to lock in lower rates while you're young and healthy, (3) plan to have a family soon, or (4) want to help cover final expenses. It's also significantly cheaper when you're younger.

How does PolicyGenius make money if quotes are free?

PolicyGenius is compensated by insurance carriers when you purchase a policy—similar to how traditional insurance agents are paid. This commission is built into the policy price by the carrier, so you pay the same whether you buy through PolicyGenius or directly from the insurer. There are no extra fees or markups.

Is PolicyGenius trustworthy?

Yes. PolicyGenius is a licensed insurance broker with licenses in all 50 states. They've helped over 30 million people shop for insurance and are rated A+ by the Better Business Bureau. PolicyGenius works with top-rated carriers (A.M. Best ratings of A or higher) and their agents are licensed professionals bound by strict regulations.

Business Financial Solutions Built for Real Entrepreneurs, Real Growth

Business growth doesn't follow a straight line, and neither does your funding journey. Maybe traditional banks turned you down. Maybe no one ever taught you how business credit actually works. Maybe you're tired of risking your personal assets for every business decision.

Real Stories from Real Business Owners
"Mesa Group Capital got us $250K when three banks said no"

"Their broker relationships made the difference. We hired two employees, bought a second truck, and doubled revenue in six months. The team was transparent about timelines and delivered exactly what they promised."

— Sarah M., Construction Company Owner | Funded: $250,000

"Funded in 18 days after months of rejections"

"The difference was night and day. Other brokers sent a generic application. Mesa Group Capital told our story and positioned us strategically across their lender network. They knew exactly which lenders would appreciate our tech business model."

— James K., Tech Startup Founder | Funded: $85,000

"Got $75K even with damaged credit from my divorce"

"I thought my credit was too damaged after my divorce. They helped me understand what their lenders actually care about and which programs I qualified for. Got $75K for inventory through their factoring partner. Now we're on track for our best year ever."

— Patricia L., E-commerce Retailer | Funded: $75,000

"$187K at 0% changed everything for my e-commerce business"

"I was stuck at $50K in revenue because I couldn't afford inventory at scale. Mesa helped me secure $187K at 0%. I 5x'd my inventory and hit $340K in revenue within 6 months. The 0% interest saved me $25K that hired two employees."

— Sarah M., E-commerce Owner | 0% Funding: $187,000

"Built business credit from zero to $75K in funding"

"Every bank told me no because my business was 'too new.' Mesa Group built our business credit from scratch and within 10 months, we had $75K in funding and landed our first municipal contract without ever risking my personal assets."

— Jennifer R., General Contractor | Business Credit Program

"Freedom from $180K in merchant cash advances"

"We owed $180K in merchant cash advances that were bleeding us dry with weekly payments. Mesa Group negotiated settlements for $68K total and restructured the rest. We're finally profitable again and actually growing."

— David L., Restaurant Owner | Debt Relief

You Built a Business to Create Opportunity—
Not to Risk Everything You Own

Every business loan application. Every piece of equipment you need. Every expansion opportunity that appears. Right now, they all have one thing in common: they're tied to YOUR personal credit. Your Social Security number. Your home as collateral. Your family's financial security on the line.

Here's what's happening every time you use personal credit for business:

Your personal credit score takes the hit. Your personal assets are exposed. Your home becomes collateral. One business setback—something completely outside your control—could wipe out everything your family depends on.

The Brutal Reality Most Business Owners Face:
Limited to $10,000-$25,000 in funding (personal credit limits)
Banks require personal guarantees and home equity
Every business purchase impacts your personal credit score
One missed payment puts your home at risk
Business liabilities become personal liabilities
Growth is capped by personal credit limits
Higher interest rates because you're the "risk," not your business
Meanwhile, businesses with established credit profiles are:
Accessing $50,000 to $150,000 without personal guarantees
Protecting personal assets from business decisions
Getting better rates and terms (even 0% promotional periods)
Scaling without being limited by personal credit
Building business equity that exists independently
Sleeping soundly knowing their home isn't on the line

What's the difference?

They discovered something most business owners don't know exists—and every day you wait costs you opportunities, limits your growth, and keeps your personal assets at risk.

What Separating Your Business Credit
from Personal Credit Really Means

Business credit isn't just about "building a score." It's about creating a firewall between your business operations and your personal life—so one never threatens the other.

WITHOUT Business Credit
Personal credit at risk with every business decision
Limited to $10,000-$25,000 in business funding
Personal assets exposed to business liabilities
Higher interest rates on business financing
Business growth tied to personal credit limits
Difficult to separate personal and business finances
Banks require home equity for business loans
WITH Business Credit
Personal credit protected from business decisions
Access to $150,000+ in business funding
Personal assets shielded from business liabilities
Lower interest rates and better terms
Unlimited business growth potential
Clear separation of personal and business finances
No personal guarantees or home equity required
Picture Your Business Standing Strong on Its Own Credit.
Imagine Your Family Protected.

Imagine this:

$50,000 approved—no personal guarantee. Equipment purchased on business terms. Sleeping soundly knowing your home isn't at risk. Taking that major contract without hesitation. That's what real business credit creates.

This isn't about paperwork. This is about:

Financial Freedom

Making business decisions based on opportunity, not fear

Asset Protection

Your home, savings, and personal credit stay completely separate

Real Scalability

Access 10-20x more capital than personal credit alone

Better Terms

Lower rates, longer terms, 0% promotional offers

Business Equity

Build a company with its own financial identity and value

Peace of Mind

Your breakthrough is one approval away—not one risk away

How Fundability® Prepares Your Business
for Maximum Funding in 5 Steps

Your business has untapped funding potential. The challenge? Most businesses don't know how to unlock it. Our proven Fundability® system shows you exactly how fundable your business is right now—and the precise steps to maximize your access to capital.

1
STEP 1: Know Your Fundability Score™ and Unlock Funding Now

See exactly where you stand and what you qualify for today

With real-time insights into your business's financial health, you'll discover how fundable your business truly is, what funding you qualify for right now, and the exact steps needed to unlock even more capital in the future.

STEP 2: Identify Fundability Factors™ Holding You Back

WHAT YOU DISCOVER:

Which of the 125+ factors are affecting you
Business structure optimization needs
Financial documentation gaps
Industry-specific approval barriers
Quick fixes vs long-term improvements

Video Walkthrough

See exactly how the Fundability® system works, what the software looks like, and how we guide you through each stage of building business credit that unlocks real funding.

With our intuitive software and dedicated full-service business credit adviser team, we streamline the process of securing business credit, guiding you effortlessly at every step.

Two Paths Forward. Same Destination.
Path 1: Build It Yourself

You can try to figure out business credit on your own. Research which vendors report. Navigate credit bureau requirements. Hope you're applying in the right order. Pray you don't damage your credit in the process.

Most business owners who go this route spend 18-24 months (if they succeed at all) and make costly mistakes along the way.

Path 2: Let Us Engineer Your Approval

We've built business credit for 720+ business owners. We know exactly which steps to take, in what order, and how to position you for maximum approval rates. Our system is proven. Our timeline is 6-12 months. Our guarantee is $50K minimum.

The question isn't "can I build business credit?"
The question is: "How much is it costing me to wait?"

Every month without business credit is another month of:

Risking personal assets on business decisions
Limited access to capital when opportunities arise
Higher interest rates and worse terms
Slower business growth tied to personal limits
Common Questions About Building Business Credit
What is a Business Credit Bureau?

A business credit bureau is an agency that collects and researches data on businesses and sells it for a fee to lenders and credit issuers to make lending decisions. It may also be called a commercial business credit reporting agency, or a corporate credit bureau. The three major business credit bureaus are Dun & Bradstreet, Experian Business, and Equifax Business.

What is a Business Credit History?

A business credit history is the number of trade payment experiences reported on business credit reports. This includes payment terms, amounts, and whether payments were made on time. Your business credit history shows lenders how your business handles credit obligations over time.

What Does it Mean to Establish Business Tradelines?

Establishing business tradelines is the act of applying to and using accounts that report to the business credit bureaus. A tradeline is any credit account—vendor accounts, business credit cards, lines of credit—that appears on your business credit report and shows your payment history.

What is a Personal Guarantee?

A personal guarantee is an individual's legal promise to repay credit issued to a business where they are an owner, executive, or a partner. With business credit agreements, giving a personal guarantee essentially makes you a co-signer on the business credit account. You remain personally liable for any debts the business incurs. In practice, this means your personal credit undergoes a hard inquiry, your personal credit score can be affected, and your personal assets are at risk if the business defaults. With strong business credit, you can eventually access funding WITHOUT personal guarantees.

What is Trade Credit?

Trade credit is credit issued by vendors to businesses for the purchase of goods or services. Instead of paying upfront, the vendor extends credit terms (like Net 30), allowing you to receive the product or service now and pay within the agreed timeframe.

What Are Business Credit Tiers?

Business credit tiers are our terminology for categorizing credit sources by difficulty level and requirements. For example: Tier 1: Vendor Credit (easy to get started, minimal requirements), Tier 2: Retail Business Credit (requires some business credit history), Tier 3: Bank Business Credit Cards (requires stronger business credit profile), Tier 4: Business Lines of Credit & Term Loans (requires established business credit profile with strong scores).

How Does Business Credit Work When Seeking Loans?

When a lending institution has more than just your personal credit scores to look at, they will review any other information they believe will better answer their one big question: Will you pay them back? Lending institutions review your business credit reports looking for: Do you pay your bills on time? Are there negative items on your credit reports? How long have you been in business? Is the business credible? If the answers to these questions satisfy the lending institution, then you're more likely to get a loan.

How Long Does It Take to Build Business Credit?

Most businesses can build a fundable business credit profile in 6-12 months with our system. Timeline breakdown: Months 1-3: Foundation setup, initial vendor accounts. Months 3-6: Additional vendor accounts, retail business credit cards. Months 6-9: Bank business credit cards, higher limits. Months 9-12: Business lines of credit, term loans, equipment financing. Some clients see approvals as early as 30-45 days, while accessing $50K-$150K typically takes the full 6-12 months.

Do I Need an LLC or Corporation?

While not legally required, having a formal business entity (LLC, Corporation, S-Corp) is strongly recommended and makes business credit building much easier and more effective. Sole proprietorships can technically build business credit, but you'll face more limitations and many lenders won't work with you without a formal business entity.

Will This Affect My Personal Credit?

When done correctly, building business credit has ZERO impact on your personal credit score. Applications, inquiries, and payment history all report under your business EIN—not your personal Social Security Number. This is one of the biggest advantages of business credit.

What's the $50,000 Guarantee?

We guarantee that if you follow our program and maintain healthy financial behaviors, we'll continue working with you until you're approved for at least $50,000 in total business funding. This means we're committed to your success. We don't just hand you software and disappear—we stay with you until you hit that $50K threshold. The $50,000 funding guarantee is based on our advisor team assisting you with securing several credit approvals, totaling at least $50,000, through each tier of funding.

What's the Difference Between Full Service and DIY?

Full Service Program ($2,495): 12 months of dedicated business credit coaching, weekly check-in calls with your advisor, custom strategy development, priority support, accountability partnership, and $50K funding guarantee. D.I.Y. Program ($995): Complete Business Credit Finance Suite software access, all educational materials and training, email support from funding specialists, self-paced learning, no coaching calls. Both programs include the same software, education, and access to our 300+ vendor/lender network. The difference is the level of guidance and support.

Can I Do This Without Your Program?

Technically, yes. However, most business owners who try to DIY business credit either fail or take 18-24+ months because they don't know: the proper sequence of applications, which vendors actually report to bureaus, credit bureau reporting requirements, how to optimize approval odds, when to move from one tier to the next. Our program compresses the timeline to 6-12 months and significantly increases success rates because we've already figured out what works.

Opens Doors to Real Funding?

With 8 funding solutions and a network of 30+ lenders, we don't force you into one-size-fits-all options. We analyze your business and match you with lenders who specialize in your industry, credit profile, and funding needs.

Fast Pre-Qualification & Approval

Time is money in business. Our streamlined process gets you pre-qualified in 24 hours and final approval within days—not weeks. Some funding options (like cash advances) can be funded same-day.

Startup-Friendly Programs

No business history? No problem. Our 2 startup programs don't require any time in business—just good personal credit (680+). Perfect for entrepreneurs launching their first venture.

Bad Credit? We Have Options

Credit scores as low as 530+ are accepted for invoice factoring. And if your credit needs work, we can help you improve it while securing funding through alternative sources like merchant cash advances (550+ credit).

Flexible Repayment Structures

Choose from fixed-payment term loans, revolving credit lines, revenue-based repayment, or daily ACH deductions based on your cash flow patterns. We structure financing that works with your business cycles.

Ongoing Strategic Support

We don't disappear after funding closes. Mesa Group Capital provides continued guidance on capital management, refinancing opportunities, and long-term financing strategies as your business grows.

Frequently Asked Questions

Get clarity on Mesa Group Capital's funding solutions.

Which funding option is right for my business?

It depends on your credit score, time in business, revenue, and funding needs. Invoice factoring is best for B2B companies with outstanding invoices and accepts the lowest credit scores (530+). Startups with no business history should look at our STARTUP programs (680+ credit required). Established businesses (2+ years, 650+ credit, $20K+/mo revenue) qualify for term loans and credit lines. Real estate investors need 620+ credit but can access up to $100M. Equipment-heavy businesses can get $1K-$20M with 700+ credit. Mesa Group Capital will help you identify the best fit during your consultation.

How fast can I get funded?

Timeline varies by funding type. Business Cash Advances and Merchant Cash Advances can fund same-day to 48 hours. Invoice Factoring typically funds within 24-48 hours. Business Lines of Credit and STARTUP programs: 3-7 business days. SBA loans and Real Estate financing: 2-6 weeks. During your consultation, we'll set clear expectations based on your chosen funding solution.

What if my credit score is below 680?

You still have options! Invoice Factoring accepts credit scores as low as 530+. Business Cash Advances accept 550+ credit. Real Estate Investment loans accept 620+ credit. If your credit is below these thresholds, we can help you work on credit improvement strategies while exploring alternative funding sources. Mesa Group Capital specializes in matching businesses with lenders regardless of credit challenges.

Do I need collateral?

It depends on the funding type. Unsecured options (no collateral): Business Cash Advances, Business Lines of Credit, STARTUP programs, and some term loans. Secured options (collateral required): Equipment Financing uses the equipment as collateral. Real Estate loans use the property as collateral. SBA loans may require collateral for larger amounts. We always prioritize unsecured options first to protect your assets.

Can I get funding if my business is brand new (no history)?

Yes! Our 2 STARTUP programs are designed specifically for businesses with ZERO time in business. The STARTUP Unsecured Business Funding (up to $150K) and STARTUP Small Business Loan (up to $150K) only require personal credit of 680+ and some verifiable personal income. No business tax returns, no years of operation required. Perfect for launching your first venture.

How much will the funding cost me?

Cost varies significantly by funding type, credit profile, and lender. Business term loans and SBA loans typically have APRs of 6-12%. Business Lines of Credit: 8-20% APR. Merchant Cash Advances and Invoice Factoring: factor rates of 1.1-1.5 (not APR). Equipment Financing: 5-15% depending on collateral. STARTUP programs: 10-25% depending on credit. We'll provide transparent cost breakdowns for all options during your consultation so you can make an informed decision.

What documents do I need to apply?

Basic requirements for most programs: Driver's License or ID, 3-6 months of business bank statements, Business tax returns (if applicable), Personal credit authorization. Additional documents may be needed for specific programs (e.g., equipment quotes for equipment financing, invoices for invoice factoring, property details for real estate). Mesa Group Capital will provide a complete checklist during your consultation.

Can I apply for multiple funding types at once?

Yes, and we often recommend it! Many businesses benefit from combining multiple funding sources. For example: 0% Business Credit Line + Equipment Financing + Invoice Factoring for comprehensive capital coverage. Mesa Group Capital coordinates timing and applications to maximize approvals while minimizing credit inquiry impacts. We call this 'Strategic Funding Combinations.'

What industries does Mesa Group Capital work with?

We work with virtually all industries, but certain funding types favor specific sectors. Invoice Factoring: B2B services, contractors, staffing agencies, wholesalers. Equipment Financing: manufacturing, construction, healthcare, transportation. Merchant Cash Advances: retail, restaurants, service providers. Real Estate: fix-and-flip investors, commercial property buyers, multi-family developers. STARTUP programs: all industries. If you're unsure whether your industry qualifies, schedule a consultation—we'll find the right option.

Is Mesa Group Capital a direct lender?

No, Mesa Group Capital is a business funding brokerage. This means we have relationships with 30+ funding partners and lenders, enabling us to match your business with the ideal funding source for your specific needs and profile. As a brokerage, we provide strategic guidance and handle the application process on your behalf, often achieving better terms than you'd get applying directly. There's no cost to you—we're compensated by the lenders.

Picture Your Business Thriving. See Yourself Seizing Every Opportunity.

Imagine accepting that major contract without hesitation. Opening your second location this quarter. Investing in equipment that multiplies your capacity. Paying yourself what you actually deserve. That's not fantasy—it's what happens with the right funding partner. Your breakthrough is one decision away.

Your Business Deserves More Than "Maybe"

You've built something real. Now it's time to fuel what's next.

Every business owner knows the feeling—the gap between where you are and where you could be isn't about ideas or effort. It's about capital. Whether you're hiring your first employee, upgrading equipment, or expanding to that second location, the right funding at the right time changes everything.

Through our brokerage division, Mesa Group Capital, we connect you with a curated network of 75+ specialized lenders—each offering different products, terms, and approval criteria. We don't just submit applications. We architect funding solutions that match your business reality.

How Much Funding Could Your Business Qualify For?

Most lenders approve 10-20% of your annual revenue for unsecured funding. See your estimated range instantly:

Note: This is an estimate. Your actual funding amount depends on credit profile, time in business, and industry. Our consultation will give you a precise assessment.

Why Most Business Funding Falls Short

You've probably heard the same story from every lender:

"Your business is too new"

"Your revenue isn't consistent enough"

"Come back when you have more collateral"

Meanwhile, competitors with deeper pockets are capturing the market opportunities you saw first. That contract you can't fulfill. The equipment upgrade that would double your capacity. The seasonal inventory that would set you up for your best quarter ever.

The irony? Banks say you need money to prove you can handle money.

We know better. Your business isn't a credit score—it's your life's work, your family's security, and your community's resource. That deserves funding partners who see the full picture.

How Mesa Group Capital Gets You Funded

Unlike traditional lenders who fit businesses into rigid boxes, we start with a simple question: What would the right capital do for your business right now?

Then we reverse-engineer the path to get you there.

Our 3-Phase Funding Strategy
1
Discovery & Diagnosis
Deep-dive business assessment (not just paperwork review)
Credit profile analysis (personal & business)
Revenue pattern evaluation
Industry-specific opportunity mapping
2
Strategic Positioning
Optimize your credit leverage points
Structure your financials for maximum approval odds
Match you with the right lenders from our 75+ partner network
Prepare application packages that tell your business story effectively
3
Execution & Funding
Submit to multiple compatible lenders simultaneously
Negotiate terms on your behalf using our broker relationships
Coordinate timing for optimal cash flow impact
Guide you through closing and fund deployment

The result? Most clients secure funding within 30-45 days—even if they've been denied elsewhere.

Setting Realistic Expectations
How Much Funding Can You Actually Get?

Here's the truth most brokers won't tell you upfront: your funding amount is tied directly to your revenue, not your dreams.

The 10-20% Rule:

As a general guideline, most lenders will approve funding equal to 10-20% of your annual revenue for unsecured products like lines of credit, term loans, and cash advances.

$100K
$10K-$20K typical funding range
$500K
$50K-$100K typical funding range
$1M
$100K-$200K typical funding range
Use Our Calculator Above to See Your Range →
Why this matters:

This prevents you from wasting time chasing $100K in funding when your business generates $80K/year. It's not that lenders don't believe in your potential—it's that they're underwriting based on demonstrated cash flow, not projected growth.

Exceptions to this rule:
Secured loans (equipment, real estate) can exceed this because collateral reduces lender risk
SBA loans often allow higher multiples with strong credit and business plans
Invoice factoring is based on receivables, not total revenue
Multiple funding sources stacked together can push past 20% total
The smart approach:

Start with funding that matches your current revenue. Deploy it strategically to grow. Then qualify for larger amounts based on your new, higher revenue. Many of our most successful clients have done 2-3 funding rounds, each larger than the last, as their business expanded.

Bottom line: We'd rather set realistic expectations upfront than promise $500K and deliver $50K.

During your consultation, we'll give you an honest assessment of what funding amounts are realistic for your revenue level.

Real Talk About Qualifications

Here's what we've learned after funding 1,000+ businesses through Mesa Group Capital:

The listed minimums are guidelines, not absolutes.

We've secured funding for clients who didn't check every box because we:

Positioned their application strategically
Found lenders within our network who value their specific industry
Built compensating factors into their profile
Timed applications when their business showed momentum

However, some fundamentals matter:

Credit utilization above 30% makes approval more challenging across most lenders
Debt-to-income ratios above 50% significantly limit available options
No credit history = no funding (you'll need established credit before applying)

If you're close but not quite there? We'll give you honest feedback during your consultation about what needs to improve before applying. In some cases, our sister company Mesa Group Consulting can help you build the credit foundation needed to qualify—but that's a separate service focused on long-term credit building, not a quick fix.

Co-signers accepted: All funding types accept co-signers to strengthen applications.

Why Mesa Group Capital Gets Better Results

Most Brokers Submit Your Application and Hope. We Engineer Your Approval.

75+ Curated Lender Relationships

We know which lenders approve which profiles, what industries they prefer, and what red flags they overlook. No wasted applications, no credit inquiry damage.

Pre-Qualification Strategy

We test the waters with soft inquiries before committing your credit. Only submit formal applications when we know approval is likely.

Application Optimization

How you present your business matters as much as the numbers. We craft applications that get approved—highlighting strengths, addressing concerns proactively, and positioning you as a smart investment.

Terms Negotiation

Mesa Group Capital has funded $50M+ in business loans through our network. Lenders give us terms they won't offer direct applicants because we bring them qualified, well-presented deals.

Post-Funding Strategy

Getting funded is step one. We show you how to use that capital to strengthen your profile and qualify for even better terms in your next funding round.

From "Maybe" to "Approved" in 4 Simple Steps
1
Free Funding Consultation (30 minutes)

We'll discuss your business, what you need capital for, and your growth plans. Together, we'll determine which funding products from our network best match your situation and timeline. This consultation is completely free with no obligation.

Schedule Your Consultation
2
Fundability Assessment (2-3 days)

We review your credit profile and bank statements to verify fundability before submitting anything. This ensures we're positioning you for success and not wasting your time or damaging your credit with premature applications. We'll identify your strongest funding pathways and set realistic expectations for approval odds and terms.

3
Network Submission & Advisor Assignment (1-2 weeks)

Once we confirm you're fundable, we submit your application strategically across our 75+ lender network to secure your best offers. You'll be assigned a dedicated funding advisor and get access to our client portal where you can track progress, upload documents, and communicate directly with our team throughout the process.

"Mesa Group Capital got us $250K when three banks said no. Their broker relationships made the difference. We hired two employees, bought a second truck, and doubled revenue in six months. The team was transparent about timelines and delivered exactly what they promised."

Construction Company Owner | Funded: $250,000

"Funded in 18 days after months of rejections. The difference was night and day. Other brokers sent a generic application. Mesa Group Capital told our story and positioned us strategically across their lender network. They knew exactly which lenders would appreciate our tech business model."

Tech Startup Founder | Funded: $85,000

"Got $75K even with damaged credit from my divorce. I thought my credit was too damaged. They helped me understand what their lenders actually care about and which programs I qualified for. Got $75K for inventory through their factoring partner. Now we're on track for our best year ever."

Your Questions, Answered
How is Mesa Group Capital different from applying directly with a bank?

Banks approve what fits their specific criteria. As a broker, we match you with lenders from our 75+ partner network whose criteria fits your business. Plus, we know how to present your application for maximum approval odds and negotiate better terms than you'd get directly.

Will this hurt my credit score?

We pre-qualify without hard inquiries through our broker relationships. Only when we're confident of approval do we submit formal applications—and even then, multiple applications within 14-45 days typically count as one inquiry for credit scoring purposes.

What if I've been denied before?

Perfect—tell us why. Previous denials give us intel on what to fix or avoid. During your free consultation, we'll review what happened and give you honest feedback about whether you're ready to apply again or if you need to strengthen your profile first. Many of our best success stories through Mesa Group Capital are clients who were denied elsewhere but got approved once we positioned them correctly.

How much does this cost?

Nothing. Mesa Group Capital's services are completely free to business owners. We earn commissions directly from lenders when your funding closes. You pay no application fees, no upfront costs, and no hidden charges. We only get paid when you get funded.

Are there really no application fees?

Correct. Unlike many brokers who charge application fees, we don't. Our entire compensation comes from the lender side of the transaction, which means our interests are perfectly aligned with yours—we both win when you get approved for the right funding at the best terms.

How fast can I get funded?

Cash advances: 24-48 hours. Lines of credit: 1-2 weeks. Term loans: 2-4 weeks. Real estate: 4-8 weeks. Speed depends on product type, lender workflow, and your documentation readiness.

Do you work with startups?

Yes. Mesa Group Capital has specific lender partners for businesses under 2 years old. Requirements differ from established business funding, but we have pathways for entrepreneurs just getting started.

What if my credit isn't good enough yet?

We'll be upfront during your fundability assessment. If you're not ready, we won't waste your time with applications that will get denied. In some cases, our sister company Mesa Group Consulting offers business credit building services to help you establish the foundation needed to qualify—but that's a separate engagement focused on long-term credit development.

Should I schedule a consultation or apply directly?

Schedule a consultation if: You've been denied before, you're unsure which product fits, your credit/revenue is borderline, or you want guidance on timing and strategy. Apply directly if: You know which product you want, you meet all the minimums clearly, and you're ready to move fast.

What's the relationship between Mesa Group Consulting and Mesa Group Capital?

Mesa Group Consulting is our advisory firm that helps businesses build credit, optimize operations, and grow strategically. Mesa Group Capital is our brokerage division that connects businesses to our network of 75+ lenders. Often clients work with both—we help them become fundable, then connect them to capital.

What Impacts Your Funding Approval?

Understanding these factors dramatically improves your success probability.

Credit Profile

Personal and business credit significantly impact approval odds and limits. Strong profiles often access 5-10x more capital.

Personal: 550+ acceptable

Business: We can help build

Business Structure

Proper structure, documentation, and compliance affect eligibility. This includes entity structure, tax compliance, banking relationships, and operational documentation.

LLC, S-Corp, or C-Corp preferred

Sole proprietors considered

Revenue & Cash Flow

Consistent revenue improves funding options. Lenders prefer predictable streams that demonstrate viability and repayment capacity.

$8K+/month for most programs

Startups: lower requirements

Certain industries have better access to specific funding types based on risk profiles and lender preferences. We match you with industry-friendly lenders.

Most industries accepted

Specialized programs available

Don't Meet All Criteria? Apply Anyway.

Our 30+ funding partners have different requirements. Even if you don't meet traditional bank standards, we often find alternative options for credit scores as low as 550+, startups with limited revenue, and businesses in challenging industries.

Bakersfield Entrepreneurs Share Their Funding Victories

Local business owners have accessed the capital they need without sacrificing cash flow to interest.

"My credit was really bad. They really helped me now. I'm buying a house."

— Mesa Group Client, Bakersfield

"Evert is amazing! The best! Helped me out from my bankruptcy and starting new credit for my business. I would recommend him to my family and friends."

— Business Owner, Bakersfield

"I got recommended from one of my family members that Evert is a very knowledgeable agent from Mesa Group Consulting which helped him establish a high credit score. I scheduled an appointment with Evert about my situation and we had a great conversation about improving my credit score."

— Referred Client, Bakersfield

"Great service, Evert was able to get me approved on a 25 Grand Cherokee."

— Auto Financing Client, Bakersfield

"Mesa Group secured $87,000 in 0% interest financing for my startup when traditional banks wouldn't even consider my application. The funding allowed me to purchase essential equipment and hire staff without worrying about crushing interest payments during our critical growth phase."

— Daniel Rodriguez, Bakersfield Entrepreneur

Business Funding Questions Answered

Get clarity before you apply.

What is 0% business funding, and how does it really work?

0% business funding refers to business credit lines with promotional 0% APR for 12-18 months. During this period, you pay no interest on the borrowed amount—only the principal. This is similar to 0% credit card offers but designed for business use with much higher limits ($25K-$250K+). After the promotional period ends, standard interest rates apply to any remaining balance, so strategic businesses pay it off during the 0% window.

What credit score do I need to qualify?

It depends on the funding type. For 0% business credit lines, we typically need personal credit scores of 680+. However, we have other funding options (merchant cash advances, invoice factoring, revenue-based financing) that accept scores as low as 550+. Even if your credit isn't perfect, we likely have options—that's why we work with 30+ funding partners with different requirements.

How much can I actually get approved for?

Funding amounts vary based on your credit profile, business revenue, time in business, and industry. For 0% credit lines: typically $25,000 to $250,000. For business term loans: up to $5 million. For merchant cash advances: up to $10 million (for very high-volume businesses). We've secured $42M+ in funding for 720+ businesses, with individual approvals ranging from $10K to $2M+. Your specific approval amount will be determined during the consultation process.

Do I need collateral or a down payment?

Most of our 0% business credit lines and unsecured term loans require NO collateral. Equipment financing uses the equipment itself as collateral. SBA loans and larger term loans may require collateral depending on the amount. We always prioritize unsecured options first to protect your business and personal assets.

How long does the approval process take?

Timeline varies by funding type. For 0% business credit lines: 3-7 business days typical. For merchant cash advances: same-day to 48 hours. For SBA loans or larger term loans: 2-6 weeks. During your consultation, we'll set clear timeline expectations based on your chosen funding solution.

What can I use the funding for?

You can use business funding for ANY legitimate business purpose: equipment purchases, inventory, payroll, marketing, expansion, working capital, debt consolidation, hiring, office space, vehicles, technology, or any other operational need. There are no restrictions on how you deploy the capital.

Will applying hurt my credit score?

We use strategic application management to minimize credit impacts. Initial consultations and soft credit checks don't affect your score. When we submit formal applications, there will be hard inquiries, but we coordinate timing to minimize the impact. Multiple inquiries for the same purpose within a 14-30 day window typically count as a single inquiry for scoring purposes.

What happens after the 0% promotional period ends?

After 12-18 months (depending on your specific terms), any remaining balance begins accruing interest at the standard APR (typically 15-25%). However, strategic businesses use the 0% period to grow revenue and pay down the principal before interest kicks in. We help you develop a repayment strategy during the deployment planning phase.

Do you work with startups or only established businesses?

Yes, we work with startups! We have specialized startup funding programs that focus on personal credit rather than business history. While some funding types require 2+ years in business, our startup programs can work with businesses as new as 3-6 months old—or even pre-revenue in some cases.

What makes Mesa Group different from other business funding companies?

Three key differences: (1) We're a Bakersfield-based local company with deep community roots and accountability. (2) We have access to 30+ funding partners, enabling us to match your specific profile with the best options rather than being limited to one lender. (3) We provide ongoing support and strategic guidance beyond just securing funding—we help you deploy capital effectively and build long-term funding relationships.

Imagine Having $150,000 in Credit Available and Paying Zero Interest for 18 Months

Let's talk real numbers. Here's what 0% capital actually means for your business.

Traditional Business Loan at 9% APR
$150K borrowed =
$1,125/month in interest
Over 18 months:
$20,250 wasted on interest

Requires:

• 2+ years tax returns

• 3-6 month approval process

Fixed monthly payments:

$3,500+ whether you're making money or not

Mesa's 0% Funding Approach
$150K at 0% APR =
$0 in interest payments
You keep:
All $20,250 for growth

Requires:

• LLCs with 6+ months history

• 700+ credit score

Minimum payments:

$50-100/month, preserving cash flow

Timeline: 30-60 days to first capital

Bottom Line: That's $20,250 you keep to reinvest. While competitors hemorrhage cash on interest, you're building an empire.

What Would You Do With $150,000 at 0% Interest Available Tomorrow?

This isn't just about capital. It's about what that capital makes possible.

Scale Without Suffocating

Hire that team. Launch that campaign. Buy that inventory. All without crushing loan payments killing your cash flow.

Real Estate Investors: Move Fast

Put $50K down on that flip while your competitor waits on hard money approval. Close deals in days, not weeks.

Launch That Second Business

You've had the idea for years. Now you have the capital to test it without risking everything.

Build Your War Chest

6-12 months of operating expenses at 0% interest. Weather any storm with confidence.

Seize Opportunities Instantly

When time-sensitive deals appear, you don't scramble for funding. You already have it.

Eliminate High-Interest Debt

Transfer $100K in 18% balances to 0% for 18 months. Save $27,000 in interest payments.

Why Mesa Clients Get 2x-6x More Capital Than Going It Alone

Anyone can Google "business credit cards." But random applications get random results. Our clients average $155K because we have what you can't Google.

1
Banking Industry Insider Knowledge

Our CEO comes from a banking background and understands exactly how banks evaluate clients and underwrite decisions. We know what triggers approvals and what causes denials—because we've seen it from the inside.

The Result: We position your profile the exact way underwriters want to see it, maximizing your approval odds and credit limits.

2
Direct Banking Relationships

We maintain personal connections with Business Relationship Managers at Chase, Bank of America, US Bank, and 40+ regional banks. Your applications go through people who know us, not algorithms that reject you.

The Result: Higher approval rates, larger limits, reconsideration support when others get stuck.

3
Strategic Sequencing System

The order you apply matters. Which bureau each bank pulls matters. We've processed thousands of funding rounds and know exactly which banks to approach, when, and in what sequence.

The Result: Maximize total capital while protecting your credit profile from inquiry damage.

4
Credit Optimization Before Applications

Most people apply before they're ready. We analyze your profile across all three bureaus and optimize every factor that impacts underwriting BEFORE we submit anything.

The Result: Position yourself for the highest limits possible—often $20K-$50K more per card.

This is why our clients average 2x-6x more funding than DIY attempts.

Our Proven Three-Round Funding Framework

Strategic sequencing across multiple rounds. Each success builds momentum for the next.

1
Foundation Round

Major national banks where our relationships are strongest. Establish your foundation and prove you can manage credit responsibly.

Timeline: 30-60 Days

Expected: $50K-$150K

2
Expansion Round

With payment history from Round 1, we tap our network of regional banks and specialized underwriters. Massive leverage happens here.

Timeline: Days 60-120

Expected: $50K-$150K Additional

3
Maximization Round

Final push leveraging your strong credit history and banking relationships. Institution-specific opportunities many miss completely.

Timeline: Days 120-180

Expected: $25K-$100K Additional

Why Three Rounds Instead of All at Once?

Banks reward established customers and payment history. By spacing applications strategically, you build the exact profile that makes banks compete to give you their highest limits. Rush it, and you leave $50K-$100K on the table.

Is 0% Business Funding Right for You?
You're a Great Fit If:

Your personal credit score is 700 or higher

This system is built on personal creditworthiness. Below 700, approval rates and limits decrease significantly.

You can manage credit responsibly

We're giving you access to $150K+ at 0%. You need to pay on time and avoid overextending.

You need capital for legitimate business purposes

Growth, inventory, marketing, real estate, hiring, equipment—anything that moves your business forward.

You're willing to follow our system

We tell you what to do and when. Going rogue sabotages the process.

This ISN'T For You If:

Your credit score is below 700

We can optimize your profile first, but you're not positioned for maximum approvals yet.

You have recent bankruptcies or major derogatory marks

Banks won't approve you regardless of our relationships.

You're looking for "free money"

This is real credit requiring real responsibility.

You need money for personal expenses

This is business funding only.

Real Clients. Real Results. Real Capital.

We can help you get there. Our credit optimization program fixes utilization, removes inaccurate items, and positions your profile for maximum approvals. Typically takes 60-90 days.

Most of our highest-funded clients started with scores in the 680-710 range. We optimized them to 720+ before Round 1, which is why they accessed significantly higher limits.

Your Role in the Process

We handle applications, you follow our blueprint

What We Handle:
Credit profile analysis and optimization strategy
Submitting all funding applications on your behalf
Coordinating directly with our banking contacts
Timing all applications strategically across three rounds
Managing inquiry distribution across all three bureaus
Guiding you through pending reviews or reconsiderations
Tracking your progress and next steps
Identifying credit limit increase opportunities
What You Handle:

Following Our Banking Relationship Blueprint

We guide you through a specific sequence of relationship-building activities that position you as a priority client.

Maintaining Strategic Communication

When banks reach out for verification or due diligence, you'll handle those conversations using our positioning framework.

Managing Your New Credit Lines

You're responsible for maintaining positive balances, making on-time minimum payments, and keeping the banking relationships we've helped you establish.

Providing Required Documentation

When we need documents (ID, business formation docs, bank statements), provide them promptly to keep your funding timeline on track.

The Bottom Line: This isn't passive—you're an active participant. But you're never guessing. We handle the applications and strategy. You follow our blueprint and maintain relationships. Think of it like having a personal trainer: We design the program and track progress. You show up and do the work. Together, we get results.

Our Performance-Based Partnership Model

We only succeed when you succeed. You never pay for promises, only results.

Small Retainer to Begin

A minimal upfront investment covers your comprehensive credit analysis across all three bureaus, custom funding roadmap, and full onboarding. This ensures we're both committed to your funding goals.

Success Fee on Results Only

Once you're approved and funded, we earn a percentage of the total capital you receive. This means:

We're incentivized to maximize your approvals
You only pay when you get actual results
Our interests are 100% aligned
No funding = no success fee
The ROI Reality

When you're accessing $150K at 0% instead of paying 9-15% on traditional loans, the math is compelling. Most clients save 3-5x their program investment in interest payments alone.

Example: $150,000 at 0% vs. 9% traditional loan

= $20,250 saved in interest over 18 months

That's real money staying in your business for growth instead of going to lenders.

What You Get
Complete credit analysis across all three bureaus
Custom funding roadmap tailored to your profile
Credit optimization included (if needed)
Guided execution through all three rounds
Direct access to our banking relationships
Reconsideration support and bureau management
Ongoing credit limit increase coaching

Your exact investment and personalized funding projection will be covered in detail during your free consultation.

What Happens After You've Maxed Out 0% Funding?

Once you've deployed 0% capital and proven your business model works at scale, bigger funding options open up:

Bank Statement Loans

$50K-$500K

After 3-6 months of using your 0% capital, you'll have business cash flow in bank statements. This qualifies you for larger loans based on deposits, not tax returns.

Traditional Business Lines of Credit

Varies

With established revenue and banking relationships from our program, you can access revolving credit with better terms.

SBA Loans & Full-Doc Funding

Major Expansion

Once you have 2+ years of tax returns showing strong revenue (built with your 0% capital), SBA loans become available for major expansion.

Mesa Group Consulting can guide you through all of these when you're ready. The 0% program is the fastest way to get capital NOW. Everything else builds from there.

Questions? We've Heard Them All.
Is this even legal?

100% legal. We're leveraging business credit cards with promotional 0% APR periods. Banks WANT to give you these cards. We just maximize approval amounts through our relationships and positioning.

Will this hurt my credit score?

Each application creates a hard inquiry (2-5 point temporary drop). However, we manage inquiry distribution strategically across all three bureaus. Most clients see scores INCREASE by 20-40 points after Round 1 due to new accounts with high limits and low utilization.

What if I get denied?

Our optimization and banking relationships dramatically reduce denials. If you do get denied, we guide you through reconsideration—often converting denials to approvals. We have backup banks for every round. One denial doesn't kill the process.

Do I need an established business with revenue?

No. These are 'no-doc' approvals based on personal credit, not business financials. LLCs with 6+ months of history qualify immediately. You don't even need business revenue yet.

What if I don't have great credit?

If your score is 700-719, you'll likely qualify but may get lower limits ($65K-$130K range). If you're below 700, we recommend our credit optimization program first. We can usually get you to 720+ within 60-90 days, then proceed with funding.

How is this different from just applying for cards myself?

Three major differences: (1) We submit applications on your behalf through our banking relationships—your applications go through people who know us, not just online portals. (2) Our strategic sequencing and bureau management prevents inquiry damage while maximizing total approvals. (3) Our optimization process positions you for maximum limits before we submit anything. DIY attempts typically result in 40-60% of the funding you'd get with our system and relationships.

What happens when the 0% period ends?

You have options: (1) Pay off the balance before interest kicks in. (2) Transfer the balance to another 0% card (we help you find these). (3) Convert it to a low-interest business loan. (4) Keep it as a revolving line if needed. We track all your promotional periods and help you plan the best strategy.

Can I use this for real estate investing?

Absolutely. Many of our clients are real estate investors using 0% capital for down payments, renovations, or holding costs. $50K at 0% can fund multiple fix-and-flips without the crushing interest of hard money loans.

What if I already have some business credit cards?

Perfect. We'll incorporate your existing cards into the strategy and focus on getting you NEW lines at the highest limits. Having existing cards often helps with approvals.

How much time does this take from me?

Round 1 requires about 5-10 hours of your time spread over 30-60 days: following our banking blueprint, answering verification calls, providing documents. Rounds 2 and 3 are even easier because the foundation is established.

What if I miss a payment?

Your 0% rate disappears, and you get hit with penalty APR (typically 29.99%). This is why we emphasize: if you can't manage credit responsibly, this program isn't for you. The upside is massive, but you must make minimum payments on time.

Is there a guarantee?

We only get paid when you get funded. Our retainer covers your analysis and strategy—the real success fee only comes when you receive actual approvals. We've never had a client with a 720+ score fail to get at least $50K in Round 1. If your score is 700-719, we'll be upfront about realistic expectations during your consultation.

You Have Two Choices Right Now
1
Keep Doing What You've Been Doing
Keep applying for traditional loans with 9-15% interest rates
Keep waiting 3-6 months for funding decisions
Keep watching $20,000+ per year vanish into interest payments
2
Access $150K at 0% Interest in 30-60 Days
Let us show you exactly how much 0% capital you can access
Get the funding you need without crushing debt payments
Build your business with capital that costs you nothing
Our Banking Relationships Are Capacity-Limited

To maintain our high approval rates and personalized service, we only take on 15-20 new clients per month. This ensures every client gets the attention their funding deserves and our banking contacts aren't overwhelmed with applications.

Is Business Debt Controlling Your Life?

You're not alone. Thousands of business owners face the same creditor pressure, sleepless nights, and constant worry about keeping their company afloat.

Creditor Harassment

Daily calls from collection agencies, attorneys, and creditors demanding immediate payment. You're afraid to answer your phone or check your mail.

Lawsuit Threats & Judgments

Facing lawsuits, wage garnishments, or bank levies? Legal threats keep you up at night and distract you from running your business.

Cash Flow Crisis

Juggling multiple minimum payments with different due dates leaves nothing for payroll, inventory, or growth. Your business is suffocating.

Bankruptcy Looming

Considering bankruptcy but terrified of losing your business assets, damaging your reputation, and paying expensive attorney fees just to file.

There's a Better Way Than Bankruptcy

Business debt relief settles debts for 30-50% less than you owe, protects your assets, and lets you continue operating while we negotiate on your behalf.

How Business Debt Relief Works

Mesa Group Capital's business debt relief program restructures your unaffordable debt into one manageable monthly payment you can actually afford—while our expert negotiators settle your debts for pennies on the dollar.

Reduce Total Debt

Settle for 30-50% less than what you owe. On average, clients complete the program paying back just 89% of their debt, including our fees.

Protect Your Assets

Guaranteed asset protection means you avoid bankruptcy and keep your business intact. No liquidation. No losing control of your company.

We Handle Creditors

Stop creditor harassment immediately. Refer all collection calls, attorney threats, and aggressive creditors to us. Get back to running your business.

Tired of Watching Your Business Drown While Creditors Take Everything You've Built?

Every day brings more collection calls, more threats, more sleepless nights wondering if today's the day you lose it all. Your business is gasping for air while debt payments consume every dollar of profit. You've poured your heart into building something—but debt is stealing your dream while competitors thrive and you're trapped watching it all slip away.

Stop the Debt Spiral
Powered by
We Resolve All Types of Business Debt

From merchant cash advances to credit cards, lawsuits to tax debts—we routinely settle every category of business debt, including secured debts and personal guarantees.

Credit Cards

Business credit cards with high balances and interest rates crushing your cash flow.

Cash Advances (MCA)

Merchant cash advances with daily payments draining your business bank account.

Supplier/Vendor Debt

Outstanding invoices and payment terms with vendors threatening to cut you off.

Lawsuits & Judgments

Active lawsuits, court judgments, wage garnishments, and legal threats.

Tax Debt (IRS/State)

Federal and state tax liabilities, payroll tax debt, and IRS notices.

Personal Guarantees

Business debts with personal guarantees putting your personal assets at risk.

Note: We handle both secured and unsecured business debts. Even if creditors have liens or collateral, our experts routinely negotiate favorable settlements that protect your business assets.

How Business Debt Relief Transforms Your Situation

Stop managing the debt crisis. Start managing your business again.

Increase Your Cash Flow

Short-term debt converted into a manageable long-term plan means more money available for operations. Instead of paying $5,000/month toward debt, you might pay $2,000/month while we negotiate settlements—freeing up $3,000/month for payroll, inventory, and growth.

Example:

$100,000 in debt with $5,000/month payments becomes $2,000/month in our program = $3,000/month saved for business operations

Improve Your Quality of Life

We deal with creditors, collection agencies, and attorneys so you can get back to doing what's important: creating revenue, not hiding from calls. Sleep better knowing experts are handling your debt crisis while you run your business.

No more creditor harassment
Dedicated negotiation team
Peace of mind restored
Avoid Unnecessary Legal Fees

Debts can be settled without attorneys. Bankruptcy lawyers charge $3,000-$10,000+ just to file—and then you lose control of your business assets. Debt settlement costs a fraction and you keep your business intact.

Cost Comparison:

Bankruptcy: $5,000-$10,000+ in legal fees + asset loss
Debt Relief: Performance-based fees only when debts settle

Fixed & Affordable Payments

Cash outlay can be forecasted and managed better. No more juggling multiple creditors with different due dates and interest rates. One predictable monthly payment lets you plan your business finances with confidence.

Frequently Asked Questions

Get answers to common questions about business debt relief and our program.

Does my company need debt restructuring?

Our program is best suited for business owners who: (1) Can't afford existing debt payments but want to pay them off at a realistic pace, (2) Need to protect assets from aggressive creditors without filing bankruptcy, (3) Don't want to go deeper into debt by borrowing again at high, unsustainable rates. If you're struggling with cash flow due to debt payments, you likely qualify.

How does the debt relief process work?

We take your large amount of unaffordable debt and make it affordable. You provide your budget—what you can realistically afford monthly—and we use that to negotiate settlements with creditors ranging from pennies on the dollar to payment in full. There are no time limits for settlements. Some creditors settle quickly after our first offers, others take longer. Most importantly, you refer harassing collection calls to us so you can focus on your business.

What types of business debt do you handle?

All types of business debts including cash advances (MCA), credit cards, suppliers/vendors, business loans, leases, tax debts (IRS/state), and equipment financing. We routinely settle lawsuits, judgments, and secured debts as well—even those with personal guarantees. If it's a business debt causing financial hardship, we can likely help.

How much will it cost me to restructure my debt?

We don't promise specific outcomes, but clients who completed our program paid back 89% of their debt over 35 months on average—including the cost of our services. This means if you owed $100,000, you'd pay approximately $89,000 total (including our fees) instead of the full $100,000. We charge NO upfront fees—our fees are performance-based and only charged as debts successfully settle.

How long will it take to complete the program?

Our clients finish the program between 2-4 years typically—sometimes faster, sometimes slower. The more you pay monthly, the faster you'll be debt-free. However, we encourage clients to commit to paying as little as necessary because when cash flow is tight, it's better to pay back less than more. If your cash flow improves, you can always increase payments and finish faster.

What reporting and updates can I expect?

As our client, you'll have 24/7 access to your secure online dashboard with over a dozen reports including: your restructuring team's background, comprehensive creditor reports showing negotiation status, monthly transaction statements, rate of funding, payment schedules, needed documentation, net savings vs. net cost analysis, and a 'finish line' tracker showing remaining debt and timeline to completion.

How will the program affect my business credit?

The truth is clients may have to temporarily sacrifice their credit score to save their business. Whether in our program or not, credit scores will decline if debts aren't paid on time. Our goal is to get you out of debt with payments you can actually afford so you can save your business and continue providing for your family. Once debts are settled and cash flow improves, you can rebuild business credit.

What's the difference between debt relief and bankruptcy?

Bankruptcy forces you to liquidate assets, damages your business reputation for 7-10 years, requires expensive attorney fees ($3,000-$10,000+), and you lose control of the process. Debt relief lets you settle debts for less, protect your assets, keep the process private, and maintain business operations. You stay in control and avoid the stigma of bankruptcy.

Can I continue operating my business during the program?

Yes! That's the whole point. Unlike bankruptcy which may force liquidation, our debt relief program is designed to let you continue business operations while we negotiate settlements. You'll have improved cash flow from reduced debt payments, allowing you to focus on revenue generation rather than debt management.

What if creditors sue me or get a judgment?

We routinely handle lawsuits and judgments as part of our program. Even if a creditor has already sued you or obtained a judgment, we can still negotiate settlements. In many cases, we resolve legal actions for significantly less than the judgment amount. The key is acting quickly before garnishments or levies begin—book your free consultation now.

Do I qualify for business debt relief?

You may qualify if: (1) You have at least $10,000 in business debt, (2) You're experiencing financial hardship or struggling with payments, (3) You can commit to a monthly payment toward settlements based on your budget, and (4) Your debts are with creditors who negotiate settlements. The only way to know for sure is to book a free consultation—we'll review your situation and provide a customized recommendation.

Are there any upfront costs or fees?

NO. We charge zero upfront fees. Our fees are performance-based, meaning you only pay as debts successfully settle. This aligns our interests with yours—we don't get paid unless we deliver results. During your free consultation, we'll explain our complete fee structure transparently so you know exactly what to expect.

Picture Your Business Thriving. Imagine Cash Flow That Lets You Breathe Again.

Imagine checking your account and seeing profit instead of red. Taking that growth opportunity without hesitation. Sleeping through the night knowing creditors are settled and your business is protected. Telling your family the storm is over—you not only survived, you're positioned to thrive. That financial freedom you deserve is one decision away.

Personal assets exposed to business liabilities

Business growth tied to personal credit limits
Difficult to separate personal and business finances
With Business Credit
Personal credit protected from business decisions
Access to $150,000+ in business funding
Personal assets shielded from business liabilities
Lower interest rates and better terms
Unlimited business growth potential
Clear separation of personal and business finances
The Business Credit Advantage

Tips for Success
Always Send Certified Mail

Use certified mail with return receipt requested. This proves the bureau or creditor received your letter and starts the legal timeline for response.

Keep Copies of Everything

Save copies of every letter you send and every response you receive. Documentation is critical if you need to escalate.

Be Clear and Concise

Stick to the facts. Don't include unnecessary personal stories or emotional appeals (except for goodwill letters).

Include Required Documentation

Only send copies, never originals. Highlight the relevant information on your documents.

Follow Up

Credit bureaus have 30 days to investigate. If you don't hear back, send a follow-up letter.

Be Patient But Persistent

Credit repair takes time. Don't be discouraged if the first letter doesn't work—escalate with follow-up letters.
