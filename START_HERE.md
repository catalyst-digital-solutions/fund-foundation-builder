# Instructions for New Claude Code Instance

**Read this first, then follow the steps below.**

## Step 1: Read the Handoff Document
Open and thoroughly read [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) to understand:
- Current project state
- Recent work completed (Calendly integration, Credit Monitoring fix, Letter Templates update)
- 9 uncommitted files that need review
- Known issues and patterns
- Critical documentation files

## Step 2: Review Uncommitted Changes
Check git status and review these modified files:
```
src/components/business-credit/sections/EmotionalCTA2.tsx
src/components/business-credit/sections/EmotionalCTA3.tsx
src/components/business-debt-relief/sections/EmotionalCTA1.tsx
src/components/business-debt-relief/sections/EmotionalCTA2.tsx
src/components/business-debt-relief/sections/EmotionalCTA3.tsx
src/pages/BusinessCreditBuilder.tsx
src/pages/BusinessDebtRelief.tsx
src/pages/BusinessFunding2.tsx
src/pages/ZeroInterestBusinessFunding2.tsx
```

These are likely from previous Calendly integration work.

## Step 3: Once You've Assimilated Everything
Ask Mario: "Ready to proceed. Should I delete HANDOFF.md and START_HERE.md now that I'm up to speed?"

---

**That's it. Read HANDOFF.md thoroughly, then check in with Mario.**
