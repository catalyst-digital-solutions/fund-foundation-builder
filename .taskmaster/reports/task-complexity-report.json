		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Pre-Deployment Verification and Build Testing",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task into specific testing phases: build verification, functional testing, cross-browser testing, and mobile responsiveness testing. Each subtask should focus on a specific aspect of the pre-deployment verification process.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves comprehensive testing across multiple dimensions (build, functionality, browsers, devices) with various technologies (Vite, React Router v6, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, GHL forms, Calendly, Google Maps). The complexity comes from the breadth of testing required and potential integration issues between different components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Vercel Project Setup and Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide this into repository connection, build configuration setup, and deployment automation configuration. Each subtask should handle a specific aspect of the Vercel setup process.",
			"reasoning": "Standard deployment platform setup with well-documented processes. The complexity is moderate due to specific Vite configuration requirements and environment variable setup, but Vercel's integration with GitHub is mature and reliable."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Preview Deployment Testing and Validation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this into deployment verification, functional testing, performance testing with Lighthouse, form submission testing, and TypeScript/React 18 feature validation. Each subtask should focus on a specific validation area.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to comprehensive testing requirements including performance metrics (Core Web Vitals > 90), end-to-end form testing, and validation of modern React features. Multiple testing tools and methodologies are required."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "WordPress Backup and Archive Creation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into Cloudways backup creation, WordPress export, local archive storage, and backup integrity verification. Each subtask should handle a specific backup method or verification step.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving multiple backup methods and platforms. Requires understanding of Cloudways infrastructure, WordPress export tools, and backup verification processes. Critical for rollback capability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Domain Configuration and DNS Setup",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into Vercel domain addition, GoDaddy DNS configuration, SSL certificate verification, and DNS propagation monitoring. Each subtask should focus on a specific aspect of the domain setup process.",
			"reasoning": "DNS configuration can be complex with potential propagation delays and SSL certificate issues. Involves coordination between multiple services (Vercel, GoDaddy) and requires careful monitoring of propagation status across geographic locations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Production Go-Live Verification",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into HTTPS accessibility verification, navigation testing, third-party integration testing (GHL, Calendly, Google Maps), performance validation, cross-device testing, and comprehensive functional testing. Each subtask should focus on a specific verification area.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity as this is the final production validation with strict performance requirements (< 3 seconds load time), multiple third-party integrations, and comprehensive cross-device testing. Any issues here directly impact user experience."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Fresh WordPress Installation and Basic Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into WordPress installation on Cloudways, Rank Math SEO plugin setup, permalink and sitemap configuration, and security plugin installation. Each subtask should handle a specific configuration area.",
			"reasoning": "Standard WordPress setup with moderate complexity due to specific SEO plugin configuration, custom permalink structure, and security hardening requirements. Cloudways platform adds some complexity to the installation process."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "WordPress Theme Installation and Customization",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into GeneratePress theme installation, child theme creation, design system implementation (colors, fonts), header/footer customization, and responsive design implementation. Each subtask should focus on a specific customization area.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to extensive design matching requirements, custom template creation, and responsive design implementation. Requires deep WordPress theming knowledge and careful attention to design consistency across platforms."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Reverse Proxy Configuration and URL Routing",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into Vercel rewrite configuration, caching header setup, SEO URL structure validation, WordPress navigation configuration, and comprehensive URL pattern testing. Each subtask should handle a specific aspect of the proxy setup.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving advanced Vercel configuration, proper caching strategies, and seamless integration between two different platforms. Requires deep understanding of reverse proxy concepts and SEO implications."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "React Site Blog Integration and Final Testing",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into React site blog link updates, navigation integration, external link handling implementation, visual transition optimization, comprehensive integration testing, and SEO validation. Each subtask should focus on a specific integration aspect.",
			"reasoning": "Highest complexity as this involves seamless integration between React and WordPress platforms, comprehensive end-to-end testing, SEO validation, and performance optimization of the complete integrated solution. This is the final critical task that ensures the entire system works cohesively."
