## Timeline

- Phase 2 Estimated Completion: 1-2 weeks depending on theme customization complexity

## Stakeholders

- Developer: Catalyst Digital Solutions
- Hosting: Vercel (React), Cloudways (WordPress)

## Dependencies

- GoDaddy DNS access

- GoHighLevel forms configured and working

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| DNS propagation delays | Medium | Low | Plan deployment during low-traffic hours |
| GHL forms not working | Low | High | Test thoroughly on preview before go-live |
| WordPress/React style mismatch | Medium | Medium | Use design system documentation |
| SEO ranking drop during transition | Low | Medium | Implement 301 redirects where needed |

## Future Considerations

- Social media automation pipeline
